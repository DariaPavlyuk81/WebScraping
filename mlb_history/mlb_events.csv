The IWW was also opposed the use of sabotage, arbitration, collective bargaining, and political affiliation.

Initiated in 1890 by the merger of the rival women's rights organizations into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), the feminist movement's priority was to push for the ratification of enough state suffrage amendments to force Congress to approve a federal amendment declaring women's rights.

No wonder, then, that Joe Maddon has watched Field of Dreams since his Chicago Cubs clinched the National League pennant. 'I cry easily,' said Maddon, the Cubs’ manager. 'So the connection to the past is very important.' To loosely quote the script, the memories could be so thick at this World Series, the fans will have to swat them away from their faces. The Cubs have gone 108 years without a championship. The Cleveland Indians have gone 68. No other team in baseball has come close to so many consecutive unfulfilled seasons. 'The baseball gods are really happy right now,' the Indians' Mike Napoli said. 'I wanted the Cubs to win, just because I knew how cool it would be to be a part of it. I think it's going to be a special World Series.

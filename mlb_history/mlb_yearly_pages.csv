YEAR IN REVIEW : 1901 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
As President William McKinley began his second term, he was fatally shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Czolgosz stated that the President was ""an enemy of good working people"" and was later judged to be sane and executed. The chief event of McKinley's administration was the war with Spain, which resulted in the United States' acquisition of the Philippines and other islands. Theodore Roosevelt was promptly sworn in as his successor and embarked on a wide-ranging program of governmental reform and conservation of natural resources.
In the American League...
On April 28th, Cleveland Indians rookie pitcher Charles Baker surrendered an American League record twenty-three singles in a 13-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox.
In May, White Stockings Herm McFarland and Dummy Hoy set one of the first American League records (most homeruns in a game) with two grand slams during Chicago's 19-9 win over the Detroit Tigers. Detroit also set a Major League mark of their own with twelve errors (ten by the infield) that was amazingly matched by the White Sox in 1903 — against the Tigers.
With two outs in the ninth, Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Bill Reidy set a Major League record after surrendering ten consecutive hits for a 13-2 loss to the Boston Somersets on June 2nd.
In the National League...
Cincinnati Reds ace Noodles Hahn struck out sixteen Boston Brave batters on May 22nd for a 4-3 victory and a record that would stand until Jim Maloney matched it in 1963.
On June 20th, Honus Wagner became the first twentieth century player to steal home twice in a single game, as the Pittsburgh Pirates blanked the New York Giants, 7-0.
The Brooklyn Dodgers tied their highest score of the previous century (May 20, 1896) after beating the Cincinnati Reds 25-6 in a September 23rd outing at League Park II.
Around the League...
The American League formally organized with the Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Somersets, Washington Nationals, Cleveland Blues, Detroit Tigers, Milwaukee Brewers, and Chicago White Sox. Three of the leagues original clubs in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Buffalo were dropped. The player limit was set at fourteen per team, and the inaugural schedule was set at one-hundred forty games.
The National League Rules Committee decreed that all foul balls are to count as strikes, except after two, catchers must play within ten feet of the batter, a ball will be called if the pitcher does not throw to a ready and waiting batter within twenty seconds, and that the umpire will remove all players using indecent language.
At the December league meeting, the Milwaukee Brewers franchise was officially dropped from the American League and replaced by the St. Louis Browns.

On April 24, 1901, the Chicago White Sox beat the Cleveland Blues 8-2 in the first ever ""official"" American League game.
The Washington Senators played their home opener in Washington D.C. on April 29, 1901. One of the prominent fans who attended was Admiral George Dewey who observed the Senators defeat the Orioles 5-2.
Did you know that Nap Lajoie of Philadelphia was intentionally walked with the bases loaded on May 23, 1901? This was the first such instance in American League history, and an amazing record that few players in Major League history have ever even tied!

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1902 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The National Bureau of the Census was established and later became part of the Department of Commerce, a federal executive department that was charged with promoting U.S. economic development and technological advancement. Among its tasks was the taking of censuses, promotion of American business at home and abroad, establishing standard weights and measures, and issuing patents and registering trademarks.
In the American League...
The Milwaukee Brewers moved before the 1902 season started and became the St. Louis Browns, where they would play until 1953. In 1954, the franchise moved and became the modern-day Baltimore Orioles.
In July, the Baltimore Orioles were forced to forfeit a game to St. Louis and their team to the league. With only five players available for the line-up, the American League's front office borrowed back-up players from several other teams and maintained the franchise for the remainder of the season.
In the National League...
The Cincinnati Reds thrashed the Philadelphia Phillies 24-2 on May 13, 1902, with each of the nine starters collecting 2-or-more hits.
Pittsburgh Pirate Honus Wagner committed ""Grand Larceny"" after stealing second, third and home during the second game of an August 13th doubleheader against the Boston Braves. Amazingly, it wasn't the first time as Wagner had originally accomplished the feat in 1899.
Around the League...
The 1902 Major League Baseball season began on April 17, and concluded on October 5. Each team played the other seven teams in their league twenty times, for a 140-game season.
Former editor of the Louisville Commercial, Harry Pulliam was elected as the President of the National League. His reputation for honesty and businesslike approach to baseball helped forge a peace between the American and National Leagues that resulted in the ""National Agreement"" that governed baseball through 1920. In February of 1909 Pulliam began showing signs of mental illness and eventually suffered a nervous breakdown. Later that year he committed suicide by shooting himself in his room at the New York Athletic Club.

Future hall of famer Addie Joss of Cleveland made his Major League debut on April 26, 1902, and one-hit the St. Louis Browns.
Did you know that the Cleveland Blues, on June 30, 1902, became the first American League team to hit three consecutive home runs during the same inning? The history-making players were Nap Lajoie, Piano Legs Hickman and Bill Bradley.
On August 25, 1902, the American League announced a team would play in New York City by 1903. On December 9, 1902, property was purchased and the New York Highlanders were nearly on the field.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1903 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Automobile pioneer Henry Ford organized the Ford Motor Company. By cutting the costs of production and by adapting the conveyor belt and assembly line to automobile production, Ford was soon able to outdistance all his competitors to become the largest car manufacturer in the world. In 1908 he designed the infamous ""Model T"" and nearly seventeen million cars were produced worldwide before the model was discontinued in 1928. Later a new design called the ""Model A"" was created to meet growing competition.
In the American League...
On May 6th, the Chicago White Sox committed twelve errors, and the Detroit Tigers answered back with six of their own. The combined ""18-E debacle"" set a modern Major League record for the most errors (by two teams) in a single game.
Buck Freeman of the Boston Americans (Red Sox), completed a cycle on June 21, 1903, the first in franchise history. Just over a month later, Pat Dougherty, also with Boston, hit for the cycle as well. The Boston Americans became the second American League team with two cycles in the same season, joining the Philadelphia Athletics (1901).
At a post-season American League meeting, Ban Johnson was unanimously re-elected president and given a raise of $10,000. The American League owners also voted to allow base-running coaches at first and third at all times and to institute the ""foul strike"" rule in which a foul would be counted as a strike unless there are already two on the batter.
In the National League...
Fred Clarke hit for the cycle on May 7, 1903. Two years earlier, on July 23, 1901, Clarke had completed his first career cycle making him the first twentieth century player to hit for the cycle twice, and the first Pirate to ever complete two cycles in Pittsburgh.
Cincinnati Reds shortstop Tommy Corcoran set a Major League record after totaling fourteen assists in a 4-2 regulation win over the St. Louis Cardinals, on August 7, 1903. Lave Cross, of the Philadelphia Athletics, had originally racked up fifteen assists during a twelve-inning game in 1897.
The National League-leading Pittsburgh Pirates set an uncharacteristic National League mark for inept fielding after making six errors in the first inning of a 13-7 New York Giants victory on August 20th.
Around the League...
In Cincinnati, peace talks between both rival leagues continued as the Nationals proposed a consolidated twelve team league, which the Americans promptly rejected. Eventually an agreement was reached to coexist peacefully with the American League promising to stay out of Pittsburgh.
Baseball rules committee chairman Tom Loftus announced that the pitcher's box would not be more than fifteen inches higher than the baselines or home plate.
The inaugural World Series of 1903 was a resounding success and represented the first step in healing the bruised egos of both the veteran National and fledgling American Leagues. Pittsburgh and Boston went head-to-head for eight games proving that great baseball between the two leagues was possible and that a merger would benefit the growth of the sport. Unfortunately, some owners still disagreed with the concept and in 1904 it was prematurely cancelled.
""(Nap Lajoie) wasn't what I would call a good manager. 'Bout all he'd say was, 'Let's go out and get those so-and-so's today.' He knew he could do his share, but it didn't help the younger fellows much."" - George Stovall

Jesse Stovall, on September 3, 1903, defeated the Detroit Tigers 1-0 in an eleven inning contest — the longest complete game shutout ever thrown by a rookie pitcher (at that point) in baseball history.
The Boston Americans captured the American League pennant when they beat Cleveland 14-3, on September 17, 1903. They advanced to the first modern World Series in history — do you remember who won?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1904 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The first section of the New York Subway system was opened between City Hall and 145th Street. The original system consisted of twenty-eight stations along 9.1 miles of track with the IRT extending to the Bronx in 1905, Brooklyn in 1908 and Queens in 1915. Since then, it has expanded to over two-hundred thirty miles of routes and over four-hundred miles of single track.
In the American League...
On May 11th, Sam Crawford of the Detroit Tigers broke Boston Red Sox ace Cy Young's consecutive streak of no-hit innings at 24 1/3 (seventy-six batters without a hit) after managing a one-out single en route to a 1-0 victory.
The St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers played a doubleheader on September 8, 1904, another doubleheader on the 9th, a third doubleheader on the 10th, then a fourth doubleheader on the 11th! After ""only"" one game on the 12th, they faced off for a final doubleheader on the 13th, setting a record for the most games played consecutively (11) between two teams in Major League Baseball history.
After pitching a record setting season with forty-one wins and four-hundred fifty-four innings in fifty-five games, New York Highlanders (Yankees) ace Jack Chesbro ""crashed and burned"" after losing control of a spitball that sailed over his catcher's head and allowed the American League pennant losing run to score from third.
In the National League...
New York Giants' Dan McGann stole five bases on May 27th during 3-1 win over the cross-town rival Brooklyn Dodgers. The record stood for seventy years until Davey Lopes of the Los Angeles Dodgers matched the mark in August of 1974. Atlanta Braves outfielder Otis Nixon eventually topped the feat with six steals (against the Montreal Expos) in 1991.
Frank Chance of the Chicago Cubs set a painful Major League mark after being hit four times in one day during a May 30th double header against the Cincinnati Reds. In the first game, ""The Peerless Leader "" actually lost consciousness after being tagged in the head by Jack Harper.
In October, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Jack Taylor tossed his thirty-ninth consecutive complete game of the season setting a modern Major League record. The streak started on April 15th and finished with an astounding three-hundred fifty-two innings pitched.
Around the League...
John T. Brush, president of the National League champion New York Giants, refused to play the returning American League champion Boston Americans. He was quoted as stating that he refused to compete with a ""representative of the inferior American League"". Surprisingly, Brush regretted the decision and later that year proposed to continue with the series as originally conceived. His about-face spawned the ""Brush Rules,"" a set of guidelines relating to the on-field play and off-field finances of the World Series, which exists to this day.
""Jack Chesbro was an early spitball ace whose 1904 performance with the New York Highlanders still rates five stars. He started 51 games, completed 48 and was the victor in 41 while hurling 454 innings."" - National Baseball Hall of Fame

Wee Willie Keeler, on August 24, 1904, hit two home runs against the St. Louis Browns and both never left the park. [Inside The Park Home Run Records]
Did you know that George Stovall, on October 7, 1904, hit a home run off his brother, right-handed pitcher Jesse Stovall? That particular feat was a Major League Baseball history and an event that remained unduplicated until the Ferrells in 1933 then the Niekros in 1976.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1905 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The ""Industrial Workers of the World"" (IWW) was founded in Chicago with the hopes of giving more control to unions. The aim of the IWW was to unite in one body all skilled and unskilled workers for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism by using direct action, propaganda, the boycott, and the strike. The IWW was also opposed the use of sabotage, arbitration, collective bargaining, and political affiliation. Unfortunately, recurring controversy during both World Wars along with accusations of treason caused dissention in the ranks from the top-down. From a probable strength of at least 30,000 in 1912, the membership later fell to less than 10,000 in 1930 and in the mid-1990s remained at less than 1,000.
In the American League...
A committee of Washington writers voted for ""Nationals"" as the new American League team nickname, but the ""Senators"" continued as the majority fan favorite.
New York Highlanders first baseman Hal Chase set a Major League record on August 5th with thirty-eight putouts during a doubleheader sweep (3-1, 6-5) versus the visiting St. Louis Browns.
In the National League...
On April 26th, Chicago Cubs outfielder Jack McCarthy tied a Major League record after starting three double plays to preserve a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jackson Nelson had originally set the DP record in 1887.
Brooklyn Dodgers shortstop Phil Lewis earned his paycheck and tied a National League record on July 20th, after having eighteen chances for seven assists, six putouts and five errors en route to a 2-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds.
Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Dave Brain became the first player in National League history to hit three triples in a single game — twice in one season (vs. St. Louis and vs. Boston).
Boston Braves first baseman Fred Tenney completed the season with a National League record one-hundred fifty-two assists. The mark stood until 1986, when Sid Bream of the Pittsburgh Pirates topped it with one-hundred sixty-six.
Around the League...
New York Giants owner John T. Brush, who refused to play the American League pennant winners in 1904, proposed a new set of rules governing future World Series. Later known as the ""Brush Rules,"" these guidelines relating to the on-field play and off-field finances of the Series are still used to this day.
The National League Board of Directors acquitted St. Louis Cardinal right-hander Jack Taylor on the charges of throwing games. Despite the verdict, Taylor was still fined $300 for using poor judgment and practicing bad conduct.
On May 30th, both leagues posted record attendance figures for the Memorial Day holiday. Due to several doubleheaders, 80,963 attended eight American League games and 67,806 witnessed seven National League events.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1906 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
More than five-hundred people were killed during the great San Francisco earthquake, which struck the ""City by the Bay"" on the morning of April 18 at 5:15 AM. Modern analysis estimated the tremors to register at an 8.25 on the Richter scale (By comparison, the quake that hit San Francisco on October 17, 1989 registered 6.7). The greatest destruction came from the fires that were ignited and the ensuing inferno ravaged the city for three days before burning out. In the end, the maelstrom destroyed four-hundred ninety city blocks, a total of 25,000 buildings and rendered over 250,000 residents homeless. Damage estimates topped $350,000,000.
In the American League...
The New York ban on Sunday baseball was temporarily lifted on April 29th as the Highlanders and Philadelphia Athletics played a benefit game for the victims of the San Francisco earthquake, raising $5,600.
St. Louis Browns first baseman Tom Jones recorded an American League record twenty-two putouts on May 11th against the Boston Red Sox. New York Highlander Hal Chase tied the record four months later (September 21), but would not be matched himself until Yankee captain Don Mattingly duplicated the effort during a 7-1 win over the Minnesota Twins on July 20, 1987.
In August, the Boston Americans set an unwanted Major League record after suffering four straight shutout losses (0-3 on August 2; 0-4 on August 3; 0-1 on August 4 and 0-4 on August 6).
In the National League...
On April 12th, Boston Braves outfielder Johnny Bates became the first modern player to hit a home run in his first Major League at bat. The inaugural round tripper came courtesy of Dodger Harry McIntire who lost twenty games or more in three seasons with Brooklyn's miserable turn-of-the-century teams.
New York Giants pitcher Hooks Wilste became the first pitcher of the modern era to strike out four batters in a single inning (after a third-strike error) en route to a twelve-K, 4-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. He also fanned the side in the fourth inning for a total of seven batters struck out in just two innings for the first and only time in Major League history.
On October 4th, the Cubs recorded their one-hundred sixteenth victory of the year. The 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates gave Chicago a 60-15-road record with a .800 percentage mark that has never been equaled. They also became the first team to finish with fewer than two-hundred errors and their pitching staff combined for a league-leading 1.76 ERA.
Around the League...
In an effort to curb accusations and/or suspicions of tampering, a new rule was set putting the umpire in sole charge of all game balls. (The home team manager previously had some say as to when a new ball was introduced).
Harry Pulliam was unanimously re-elected president of the National League with an increased salary of $10,000. The American League increased Ban Johnson's salary to $15,000 for the remaining four years of his contract.
Hank O'Day, a National League umpire unsuccessfully proposed that the batter's box be outlined with white rubber strips (rather than chalk) to prevent batters from erasing them with their spikes.

Tom Hughes, of the Washington Senators, hit a game-winning home run in the tenth inning on August 3, 1906, and became the first pitcher in major league history to win an extra inning game with his own long ball!
On August 30, 1906, Slow Joe Doyle of the New York Highlanders shutout Washington 5-0 in his second start. He finished his Major League career with twenty-three wins and will always be remembered as the first pitcher to toss two consecutive shutouts during his two first starts.
Did you know that future hall of famer Eddie Collins made his Major League debut on September 17, 1906, and had one hit off Ed Walsh? Too easy? Did you know that Collins played that game under the last name Sullivan to preserve his college eligibility at Columbia University?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1907 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
In November, Oklahoma became the forty-sixth state admitted to the union. Originally set aside as Indian Territory in 1834, the region was later divided into both the Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory in 1890. Known primarily as an oil rich state, Oklahoma's vast plains produce bumper yields of wheat, as well as large crops of hay, cotton, and peanuts. Livestock products also contribute more than half of Oklahoma's annual farm receipts.
In the American League...
Popular Boston Americans outfielder / manager Chick Stahl committed suicide while traveling with the team in West Baden Springs, Indiana. A note left behind stated: ""Boys, I just couldn't help it. You drove me to it."" Cy Young reluctantly agreed to start the season as an interim replacement manager and was followed by two other skippers during the year, George Huff and Bob Unglaub.
Chicago White Sox pitcher Ed Walsh tallied eleven assists and two putouts during a 1-0 win over the St. Louis Browns on April 19, 1907. His total of thirteen chances tied the franchise mark set by Nick Altrock during the 1904 season — which is also the Major League record for most chances in a 9-inning game by a pitcher!
On June 28th, the last place Washington Nationals stole a Major League record thirteen bases off of injured New York Yankees catcher Branch Rickey. An injury to starter Red Kleinow forced Rickey into premature service and he was unable to throw accurately to his baseman.
In the National League...
A riot broke out during a July 8th, Chicago Cubs - Brooklyn Dodgers game after Cubs manager Frank Chance, who was being pelted with empty bottles, threw one back into the crowd hitting a young boy. After losing 5-0, the angry New York crowd rushed from the stands forcing Chance to escape Washington Park III in an armored car with a police escort.
At the West Side Grounds on September 14th, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds collected twenty-nine combined hits, ALL of which were singles.
On May 8th, Philadelphia Phillies rookie George McQuillan made his Major League debut in relief of starter Tully Sparks and McQuillan did not allow any runs to score during his brief debut. On September 22nd, he tossed a six-inning, 2-0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals in his first start. The relief and end of season appearance started a record string of twenty-five consecutive shutout innings at the beginning of his Major League career. McQuillan went on to finish the season 4-0 (with three shut outs), and went on to win twenty-three games the following season.
Around the league...
The Cleveland Indians became the first team to institute team wide insurance policies after taking out $100,000 of coverage to insure its players against possible injury in railroad accidents.
Cincinnati Reds' manager Ned Hanlon, one of the originals whose managing days began in 1889 at Pittsburgh, announced his retirement ending a career that boasted five Major League pennants (four Baltimore, one Brooklyn).
The Washington Post (incorrectly) reported that St. Louis Browns shortstop Bobby Wallace was the highest paid major league player with a yearly salary of $6,500.
""Boys, I just couldn't help it. It (drugs) drove me to it."" - Chick Stahl (Last spoken words & news at the time said he and his wife were drug addicts - source: The Cultural Encyclopedia of Baseball)

Weird ballpark stories? How about the flagpole breaking on the 14th of May as the White Sox were raising their 1906 pennant in South Side Park.
On August 2, 1907, future hall of famer Walter Johnson made his major league debut and lost 3-2. The first hit off the future 300 Wins Club member was by Ty Cobb — a bunt single!
Since we mentioned The Georgia Peach; did you know that Cobb finished the 1907 season with a league leading .350 batting average, and would go on to win eleven more batting titles across his storied career? [Batting Champion Records]

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1908 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
President Theodore Roosevelt held the ""White House Conservation Conference"", which later led to the establishment of the National Conservation Commission. The main purpose of the Commission was to implement new regulations for conserving the earth's natural resources by protecting its capacity for self-renewal. Particularly complex were the problems of nonrenewable energy resources such as oil and coal and other minerals that are still in great demand today.
In the American League...
On April 14th, Boston played their first game under the new nickname, the ""Red Sox"" and christened it with a 3-1 win over the Washington Senators at the Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds.
The Detroit Tigers set a unique Major League record on June 7th after turning a triple play against the Boston Red Sox for the second day in a row.
Bob Rhoads, of the Cleveland Naps, tossed a no-hitter on September 18, 1908, against the newly named BoSox. Cleveland wins 2-to-1.
In the National League...
In March, Honus Wagner announced his retirement from the Pittsburgh Pirates at the age of thirty-four. Despite the intention, he went on to play in one-hundred fifty-one games (more than in any of the past ten years) and led the league in hitting (for the sixth time), hits, total bases, doubles, triples, RBIs, and stolen bases.
On May 23rd, New York Giants third baseman Art Devlin tied a Major League record by handling thirteen total chances during a 6-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.
Around the League...
In 1908, the original sacrifice fly rule was adopted. It stated: No ""time at bat"" was charged — if a run scored after the catch of a fly ball. The rule was later repealed in 1931 and went through several variations before permanent acceptance in 1954.
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary (after a two-year investigation by the Mills Committee) National League president A.G. Mills declared that Abner Doubleday had indeed, invented the sport of baseball at Cooperstown, New York in 1839.
Henry Chadwick, a leading reporter, commentator, scorer, and promoter of the game, died in Brooklyn at the age of eighty-three. Chadwick was known as ""The Father of Baseball"" and is credited with developing the initial scoring and statistical systems for the game.
Singing sensation Billy Murray hit the charts with ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"".
""All us Youngs could throw. I used to kill squirrels with a stone when I was a kid, and my granddad once killed a turkey buzzard on the fly with a rock."" - Cy Young

On June 30, 1908, Cy Young tossed his third career no-hitter. He was the oldest pitcher, forty-one at the time, to hurl a gem until Nolan Ryan beat the record on June 11, 1990. That was Ryan's sixth no-hitter and he was forty-three. On May 1, 1991, Ryan pitched his seventh and final no-hitter at the record setting age of forty-four.
On October 2, 1908, Addie Joss sat down twenty-seven consecutive batters during the second American League perfect game. Do you remember which American League pitcher tossed the first gem?
On October 5, 1908, Ed Walsh of the White Sox won his season leading fortieth game. This victory tightened the pennant race between Detroit, Cleveland, and Chicago - bringing it down to the final day.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1919 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
A federal prohibition act known as the ""Volstead Act"" was passed over the veto of President Woodrow Wilson making provisions for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, which strictly forbid the manufacturing, sale, importing, or exporting of all intoxicating liquors. The act defined an intoxicating beverage as one containing more than .5% alcohol by volume and included all hard liquors and wines. It also gave federal agents the power to investigate and prosecute violations of the amendment at their own discretion.
On September 9th, three-quarters of the Boston police force voted to go on strike. Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge quickly intervened to dismiss the strikers, stating that no labor dispute would be allowed to compromise public safety.
Race riots erupted in twenty-six U.S. cities during the summer including an extremely violent protest in Chicago that left thirty-eight dead, more than five-hundred injured, and many more homeless. The killing of a black teenager at the 26th Street beach sparked the conflict, but racial tension had been brewing in the ""Windy City"" for years.
In the American League...
In December, Colonel Jacob Ruppert purchased Babe Ruth from Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee. The New York Yankees owner paid a reported sum of $125,000 and guaranteed a $300,000 loan with Fenway Park as collateral for the promising pitcher / infielder (13-wins / 11-home runs).
Chicago White Sox ace Eddie Cicotte (a member of the ""Black Sox"" scandal) beat the Philadelphia Athletics for the second time on June 14th en route to a 29-7 season and an astounding 1.82 ERA.
On June 23rd, Boston Red Sox first baseman Stuffy McInnis made his first fielding error after successfully handling five-hundred twenty-six chances.
In the National League...
On June 8th, the Philadelphia Phillies outsmarted the New York Giants and broke the record for most stolen bases in an inning (set by Washington in 1915) after four runners made it to first base in the ninth and each stole both second and third.
Brooklyn Dodger Ed Konetchy went five-for-five on June 29, 1919, then collected his tenth straight hit on July 1st during a 9-4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies, tying a record set by Washington's Jake Gettman in 1897.
The National League voted to ban the use of spitball's by all new pitchers. The ban was formally worked out by the Rules Committee the following February and was expanded to include the use of all foreign substances (saliva, resin, talcum powder, paraffin) as well as any other alterations (shine or emery) to balls by pitchers.
Around the League...
Anticipating a poor season at the gate, major league owners decided to open a reduced one-hundred forty game season. Despite the lack of close races, attendance remained high all year and every club managed to show a profit at the end of the year.
The 1919 World Series ignited the infamous ""Black Sox"" scandal after eight members of the participating White Sox including pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Claude (Lefty) Williams, outfielders Joe Jackson and Happy Felsch, first baseman Chick Gandil, shortstop Swede Risberg, third baseman Buck Weaver and reserve infielder Fred McMullin were all charged with conspiring to fix the outcome of the Fall Classic against the Cincinnati Reds. Cynics were tipped off before the Series even started when the pre-game betting odds swapped shortly before the first game. Despite the rumors, most fans and members of the press accepted the games to be true, but all that would change in 1920 as suspicions turned into confessions. To this day participants in the conspiracy have been denied entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
""I have pitched the best ball of my life, but I am not winning. The team (Red Sox) just doesn't win when I'm pitching, so I'm going home to Pennsylvania."" - Carl Mays (July 12, 1919)

On April 23, 1919, Walter Johnson threw a record fifth career Opening Day shutout. President Woodrow Wilson missed this occasion, but sent Army Chief of Staff General Peyton C. March who became the first active General to throw out an Opening Day pitch.
Did you know that on May 20, 1919, Babe Ruth, who pitched seventeen games during the season for the Red Sox, hit his first career grand slam (6-4 win versus St. Louis)?
Strange, but true — on August 24, 1919, Ray Caldwell of Cleveland was about to deliver a pitch when he was struck by lightning. Caldwell recovered and won the game 2-1 versus the Athletics.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1920 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After several decades, the Nineteenth Amendment was finally added to the Constitution granting nation-wide suffrage to women. Initiated in 1890 by the merger of the rival women's rights organizations into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), the feminist movement's priority was to push for the ratification of enough state suffrage amendments to force Congress to approve a federal amendment declaring women's rights. Despite some radical factions that continued to address corollary issues, NAWSA's new approach focused the group's energies exclusively on recruiting new members and winning the vote for women.
In the American League...
On January 5th, the New York Yankees officially announced the purchase of Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox. The disgruntled pitcher had been unable to reach a contract agreement and was eventually sold to Colonel Jacob Ruppert for $100,000 (plus a loan collateralized by Fenway Park). Later, his .376 batting average, fifty-four home runs and one-hundred thirty-seven runs batted in would generate an attendance of 1,289,422 fans in his first year and lead to the construction of Yankee Stadium.
The Detroit Tigers lost their first thirteen games tying the Major League mark for consecutive losses (at the start of a season) set by the 1904 Washington Senators.
Tragedy struck the Cleveland Indians organization after twenty-nine year-old shortstop Ray Chapman was beaned in the head on August 16, 1920, by a Carl Mays pitch and died the following day from a fractured skull.
In the National League...
A plan originally developed by Brooklyn Dodgers owner Charles Ebbets many years ago was finally adopted with the annual drafting of players from the Minor Leagues taking place in reverse order of each teams' final standings.
Several hours before the start of Game 4, Brooklyn Robins standout Rube Marquard (a Cleveland native), was arrested after attempting to sell a World Series ticket to an undercover police officer for $350. Marquard was later found guilty and ordered to pay a fine and court costs totaling $3.80. Adding insult to injury, his hometown opponents went on to win the game 5-1.
On December 15th, the National League revealed a startling statistic by reporting the use of 27,924 baseballs during the season, which represented an increase of 10,248 over 1919.
Around the League...
The Joint Rules Committee voted to ban the use of all foreign substances (saliva, resin, talcum powder, paraffin) as well as any other alterations (shine or emery) to balls by pitchers. As a result, the American League opted to allow two pitchers from each club the option to use a spitball for one more season. The Nationals set no limitations as long as all ""practicing"" pitchers were identified and any other pitcher who was caught cheating would be suspended for a minimum of ten days.
Lou Gehrig (a junior at New York City's School of Commerce) was introduced to the nation after hitting a grand slam out of Wrigley Field during a high school championship game against Lane Tech on June 26th.
The 1919 World Series sparked a major controversy amid rumors of a gambling fix. Eight members of the participating Chicago White Sox were all charged with conspiring to throw the Fall Classic against the Cincinnati Reds. After a lengthy investigation and highly publicized trial (lasting until 1921), the ""Black Sox"" were acquitted despite their own confessions. Throughout the 1920 season, the league offices were constantly denying accusations from the press that professional baseball itself was in on the take and made every effort to assure the fans that the 1919 scandal was an isolated incident.
""I'd play for half my salary if I could hit in this dump (Wrigley Field) all the time."" - Babe Ruth

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1921 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The first burial of an unidentified soldier who had been killed in France during WWI was held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on November 11th. On Memorial Day, 1958, the bodies of two other unknown soldiers; one of whom had died in World War II, the other during the Korean War, were also buried in the tomb, which was later renamed the Tomb of the Unknowns.
The United States, Britain, Japan, France and Italy met for the Washington Naval Convention and agreed on a treaty limiting worldwide naval powers. The treaty called for a ratio of naval ships of five to three to 1.7. As a result, for every five large ships in the U.S. British fleets, Japan could have three, and France and Italy, 1.7. The United States also agreed to scuttle thirty of its own war ships as a result of the treaty.
In the American League...
The New York Yankees purchased a twenty-acre plot of land in the Bronx as the future site for Yankee Stadium.
During an August 19th doubleheader between the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox, Ty Cobb became the youngest player (thirty-four) ever to reach three-thousand hits.
Jimmy Dykes handled an American League record seventeen chances at second base for the Philadelphia Athletics, as they took on the St. Louis Browns at Sportsman's Park III on August 28th. Dykes averaged one-hundred twenty-five games in thirteen full seasons with the A's, but only once played the same position all year — second base in 1921.
In the National League...
On July 8th, an order was issued that allowed fans to keep any balls hit into the stands at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. Up until that point, all foul and homerun balls were still considered property of the league and were expected to be returned.
The first radio broadcast of a major league game was heard on August 5th over the country's first established radio station, KDKA in Pittsburgh. Harold Arlin, who also announced the first football game between Pittsburgh and West Virginia, called the 8-5 Philadelphia Phillies win over the hometown Pirates.
Around the League...
Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was officially named as baseball's commissioner with a contract for seven years at $50,000 per year. Landis was a judge in an Illinois federal district court when he came to the attention of baseball's establishment during the Federal League's antitrust suit, which was heard in his court.
Major League umpires began the practice of rubbing dirt into the balls before each game, using special clay supplied by Philadelphia Athletics' coach Lena Blackburne from his New Jersey farm.
On August 2nd, a Chicago jury rendered a ""not guilty"" verdict against the infamous ""Black Sox"" who had been accused of throwing the 1919 World Series in favor of the Cincinnati Reds. Ignoring the verdict, Judge Landis banned all eight defendants from major league baseball for life. ""Regardless of the verdict of juries,"" the commissioner said in a statement, ""no player that throws a ball game, no player that entertains proposals or promises to throw a game, no player that sits in a conference with a bunch of crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing games are discussed, and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever again play professional baseball."" To this day participants in the ""Black Sox"" conspiracy have been denied entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
""I guess that will learn Ban Johnson he can't frame an honest bunch of ballplayers."" - Chick Gandil

On June 27, 1921, the ""Black Sox"" trial heard opening statements before Judge Hugo Friend. On August 2, 1921, the jury, after twp hours of deliberation, acquitted the players then proceeded to carry them on their shoulders inside the courtroom before joining them at a local restaurant that same day for a celebration meal.
Roger Connor played baseball from 1880 through 1897 and hit a Major League record 138 career home runs — the most by any baseball player in history at that time! On July 18, 1921, Babe Ruth broke that record when he hit career home run number 139 during the eighth year of a 22-year career.
In 1912, Bert Daniels hit for the cycle with the New York Highlanders. Why mention that here? Because Bob Meusel, on May 7, 1921, hit for the cycle as well, the first to do so after the franchise officially changed their name to the New York Yankees.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1922 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On March 20th, at Norfolk, Virginia, the U.S.S. Langely was commissioned as the first United States Naval Aircraft Carrier. Originally a coaler christened the Jupiter, the mammoth vessel was refurbished for the purpose of conducting experiments in the new idea of seaborne aviation. At the outbreak of World War II, Langley was anchored off Cavite, Philippine Islands and was ordered to proceed to Balikpapan, Borneo, and Darwin, in Australia, where she assisted the RAAF in running antisubmarine patrols out of Darwin. She was then assigned to American-British-Dutch-Australian forces assembling in Indonesia to challenge the Japanese thrust in that direction. Early in the morning of February 27th, 1942, Langley rendezvoused with her usual antisubmarine screen of Navy destroyers as nine twin-engine enemy bombers attacked her. The first and second Japanese strikes were unsuccessful; but during the third Langley took five hits igniting several planes on the flight deck. After an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish the flames, the order to abandon ship was passed. The escorting destroyers fired nine four-inch shells and two torpedoes into the old tender to insure her sinking and she went down about seventy-five miles south of Tjilatjap with a loss of sixteen.
In the American League...
During a 5-4 win over the Detroit Tigers at League Park II on June 3rd, Cleveland Indians first baseman Stuffy McInnis committed his first error in an astounding one-hundred sixty-three games and one-thousand six-hundred twenty-five chances.
On April 30th, in just his fourth career start, Chicago White Sox pitcher Charlie Robertson pitches the fifth perfect game in Major League history. Chicago tops the Detroit Tigers, 2–0, at Navin Field in Detroit.
Chicago and Boston combined to set an American League record with thirty-five singles (Chicago, twenty-one and Boston, fourteen) during a 19-11 White Sox victory on August 15th.
In the National League...
Ten Pittsburgh Pirates collected two or more hits (twenty-two total) on August 7th to rally over the seventh place Philadelphia Phillies 17-10. The Phils were headed for a storybook comeback (after scoring six runs in two 2/3 innings), but the Buccos added eight of their own in the fourth to take the lead. The following day Pittsburgh set a Major League record with forty-six hits during a doubleheader against Philadelphia.
On August 25th, the Chicago Cubs managed to edge out the Philadelphia Phillies 26-23 in one of the worst combined pitching performances in baseball history. The game itself featured fifty-one hits, twenty-one walks, and nine errors with the Phillies stranding sixteen men on base and the Cubs leaving nine.
Rogers Hornsby completed the season with a .401 average making him the first .400-hitter in the National League since Ed Delahanty in 1899. He also set a National League record with two-hundred fifty hits, another with one-hundred two extra-base hits and was awarded the Triple Crown with one-hundred fifty-two runs batted in and forty-two home runs.
Around the League...
For the first time since 1900, there were no playing managers in the National League. It would be 1930 before the American League would follow suite and bench all of its managers.
Following a lawsuit brought by the Federal League's Baltimore franchise, the U.S. Supreme Court voted 9-0 that professional baseball (on any level) was not considered an interstate business.
In an effort to curb the rise of home run hitting (one-thousand fifty-four in the major leagues, up from nine-hundred thirty-six), several American League owners proposed a new zoning system that called for a minimum distance of three-hundred feet for a round-tripper to be ""official"". Although that motion was denied, another action that required all teams to furnish two uniforms per player was passed and at the National League meeting Charles Ebbets proposed the addition of numbers on players' sleeves or caps.
""They (the fans) can boo and hoot me all they want. That doesn't bother me, but when a fan calls insulting names from the grandstand and becomes abusive I don't intend to stand for it. This fellow today (May 25, 1922) `called me a 'low-down bum' and other names that got me mad."" - Babe Ruth

Do you know which pitcher never had a winning season during his Major League career yet managed to throw a perfect game on April 30, 1922?
Ty Cobb hit .401 in 1922 yet lost the batting title to George Sisler of the St. Louis Browns who finished the season hitting .420. However, 1911 was actually the first instance in the American League were a .400 hitter (Ty Cobb again!) beat another .400 hitter (Joe Jackson) for the batting title.
On September 30, 1922, Babe Ruth was ejected by umpire Tom Connolly for abusive language. A heckler became Ruth's next target, but Connolly intercepted and told Ruth, ""You should be ashamed of yourself."" Ruth returned to the dugout and was never ejected from another baseball game during his career.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1923 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
President Warren G. Harding suddenly fell ill on July 28th while returning from a trip to Alaska and was rushed to a San Francisco hospital where he died of a heart attack on August 2nd. Harding's undeviating Republicanism and vibrant speaking voice led him far in Ohio politics. He originally served in the state Senate and as Lieutenant Governor, but unsuccessfully ran for state Governor later. Harding's career soared after he delivered the nominating address for President Taft at the 1912 Republican Convention and he was eventually elected to the Senate in 1914. Many local supporters began to promote Harding for the 1920 Republican nomination and he went on to win the Presidential election by an unprecedented landslide of sixty percent of the popular vote.
The second Ku Klux Klan movement in U.S. history was initiated stirring widespread controversy and racial violence. Professing itself nonpolitical, the Klan nevertheless controlled politics in many communities and in 1922, 1924, and 1926 elected many state officials and a number of Congressmen. Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Oregon, and Maine were particularly under its influence. Its collapse thereafter was largely due to state laws that forbade the wearing masks in public, which eliminated the secret element, and apparently from the declining interest of its members.
In the American League...
Yankee Stadium debuted when ""The House That Ruth Built"" opened its doors on April 18th to an announced attendance of 74,217. ""The Babe"" himself provided the ""house warming gift"" with a three-run home run that beat Howard Ehmke and the Boston Red Sox 4-1.
On May 25th, Detroit Tigers legend Ty Cobb scored his one-thousand seven-hundred forty-first run to pass another legend, Pittsburgh Pirate Honus Wagner. ""The Georgia Peach"" went on to hold ninety separate Major League records when he retired in 1928.
The Cleveland Indians set an American League record on July 7th after scoring in every inning against the Boston Red Sox. In eight innings (the home team did not bat in the ninth), ""The Tribe"" ran up twenty-seven runs, including thirteen in the sixth, for an embarrassing 27-3 win.
In the National League...
On April 7th, the longest National League opener (to date) took place with the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies battling head-to-head for a grueling, fourteen innings and a 5-5 tie.
A riot broke out in Chicago on September 16th after umpire Charlie Moran made an ""out"" call at second base on Sparky Adams. Commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was in attendance and shook his cane at the angry mob as Moran and the other officials were pelted by hundreds of empty bottles. After holding up play for over fifteen minutes, the game resumed with the visiting New York Giants winning 10-6.
Dolf Luque of the Cincinnati Reds finished his season in style after posting an 11-1 finale over the St. Louis Cardinals. Following the game, Luque returned to Havana with a Major League leading win-loss record of 27-8 which is still the best single-season mark ever posted (to date) by a Latin American pitcher.
Around the League...
Pitching legend Christy Mathewson became the president of the Boston Braves franchise after purchasing the club with New York attorney Judge Emil Fuchs and Bostonian James McDonough for a reported sum of $300,000. However, Braves Field remained in the custody of former owner James Gaffney and eighty-five minority stockholders.
The St, Louis Cardinals announced plans for their players to wear numerals on their uniforms, and number them according to the team's batting line-up.
Two members of the infamous ""Black Sox Scandal"", in which the 1919 World Series was ""fixed"" in favor of the Cincinnati Reds, attempted to sue their former team, the Chicago White Sox. Swede Risberg and Happy Felsch unsuccessfully sought $400,000 in damages and $6,750 back salary for conspiracy and injury to reputation. Both men, along with all Chicago players involved in the incident, had been banned from baseball due to their undeniable link to gamblers.
No games were played on August 3rd following the death of President Harding in San Francisco. The entire major league schedule was also canceled one week later on the day of his funeral.
""I'm going to break it up (September 4, 1923 Sam Jones no-hitter) if I can."" - Chick Galloway (who bunted and was thrown out with two outs during the ninth inning)

On April 18, 1923, Yankee Stadium opened its doors for the first time and 74,200 fans packed The House That Ruth Built. Babe Ruth himself commented, ""I'd give a year of my life if I can hit a home run in this first game in this new park."" During the third inning, Ruth gave up a year of his own life when he launched a Howard Ehmke curve over the right field fence for his 199th career home run.
On May 2, 1923, Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators pitched a 3-0 shutout versus the New York Yankees. The shutout was the 100th of Johnson's career and it made him the first (and only) pitcher with 100 career shutouts - yet the event when virtually unnoticed.
Other notable dates during the 1923 season included: July 22 - Walter Johnson becoming the first to join the 3,000 Strikeouts Club; September 4 - Sam Jones no-hitter (the second by a Yankee) over the Athletics; September 7 - Howard Ehmke no-hitter over the Athletics (again!); and September 14 - George Burns unassisted triple play.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1924 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall and oilmen Harry Sinclair and Edward L. Doheny were all charged with conspiracy and bribery in the ""Teapot Dome scandal"" which involved fraudulent leases of naval oil reserves. Fall was later indicted for conspiracy and for accepting bribes and after being convicted of the latter; he was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $100,000. In another trial for bribery Doheny and Sinclair were acquitted, although Sinclair was subsequently sentenced to prison for contempt of the Senate and for employing detectives to shadow members of the jury in his case. Eventually, the oil fields were restored to the U.S. government through a Supreme Court decision in 1927.
In the American League...
During a 12-4 Philadelphia Athletics' victory over the Cleveland Indians, first baseman Joe Hauser set an American League record with three homeruns and a double for a total of fourteen bases. Ty Cobb later broke the record with sixteen bags of his own on May 5, 1925.
On May 1st, White Sox shortstop Bill Barrett stole home twice (first and ninth innings) tying the Major League mark for home-plate thievery. Chicago went on to beat the Cleveland Indians 13-7.
Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson struck out fourteen on May 23rd (including six in a row) for a 4-0 one-hitter over the Chicago White Sox and his one-hundred third shutout. Johnson went on to finish the season with his best record in five years while going 23-7.
In the National League...
On April 15th, Rogers Hornsby of the St. Louis Cardinals went two-for-five on Opening Day (against Vic Aldridge of the Chicago Cubs) giving him a .400 batting average with one game under his belt. Later in the season, his .424 batting average would mark the highest Major League batting average of the twentieth century and from Opening Day forward his average never dipped at or below the .400 mark again.
Giant's first baseman George Kelly went ""solo"" on June 14th after hitting three homers to drive in all of New York's runs during an 8-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Over a decade later, Bob Johnson of the Philadelphia Athletics matched the ""one-man-show"" with an 8-3 win over the St. Louis Browns.
On July 11th, Chicago Cubs first baseman Lee Cotter equaled a Major League record with twenty-one putouts and one assist during a 9-1 loss against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Around the League...
Following the American League's lead, the Nationals agreed to offer a $1000 cash prize to the player named their most valuable player as selected by an exclusive panel of sports writers.
Sen Kaney called the first live radio broadcast (from a grandstand behind home plate) on October 1st at Cubs' Park in Chicago. The home team went on to beat their cross-town rival White Sox with a solid 10-7 effort.
On December 10th, both leagues agreed to a permanent rotation system for World Series play with the first two games at one league's park, next three at the other leagues park, last two (if needed) back at the first league's park, and all future openers to alternate between leagues. The National League was granted the inaugural advantage in 1925.
""The good Lord just couldn't bear to see a fine fellow like Walter Johnson lose again."" - Jack Bentley

On June 19, 1924, George Burns of the Indians hit three doubles and a home run. On July 21, 1924, Burns hit two doubles and two home runs making him the first major league player to have four extra-base hits during a game twice during the same season.
On August 28, 1924, Babe Ruth went deep twice. However, the Washington Senators would rally and defeat the Yankees 11-6 to take over first place on their way to their first ever American League pennant.
At the completion of the 1918 season Walter Johnson became the first American League pitcher to earn the Triple Crown twice. In 1924 Johnson led the league in wins (23), earned run average (2.72), and strikeouts (158) making him the first junior circuit pitcher to win the Triple Crown three times.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1925 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
One of the most sensational court cases in twentieth-century America, the ""Scopes Monkey Trial"" went infinitely beyond the boundaries of law and the courtroom to question the social, intellectual, and cultural values of America. In 1925, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced that it was willing to financially support anyone challenging a recently enacted Tennessee law that prohibited the teaching of Darwinism in the state's schools. John T. Scopes, a twenty-five year-old high-school science teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, who taught evolution in his school biology class, accepted the ACLU offer and agreed to stand as the defendant in a test case to challenge the law. At the conclusion of the hearings, Scopes' attorney asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court where, he hoped, the anti-Darwin law would be overturned. The jury, complying with his request, returned a verdict of guilty and fined Scopes $100.
In the American League...
Ty Cobb set another one of his many Major League records on May 5th after going six-for-six, (including three home runs) in a Detroit Tiger win over the St. Louis Browns. Cobb's sixteen total bases topped the American League record previously set by Joe Hauser (fourteen) on August 2nd of 1924.
Boston Red Sox outfielder Ira Flagstead initiated three double plays on May 19th in an 8-2 loss to the St. Louis Browns breaking the record previously set by Tris Speaker in 1918. (All of Speaker's were unassisted).
Rookie Ben Paschal of the New York Yankees hit two inside-the-park home runs, in an 11-6 win over the Chicago White Sox on September 22nd. Paschal totaled seven home runs in the month of September setting a franchise record (for rookies) that stood until 1998.
In the National League...
Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Glenn Wright pulled off the impossible after completing a solo triple play at second base during a 10-9 win over the St. Louis Cardinals on May 7th. Wright ended the game after snagging a Jim Bottomley line drive while simultaneously stepping on the bag before Johnny Cooney could return. Then he tagged Rogers Hornsby who was attempting to retreat after coming down from first base.
Second baseman Milt Stock of the Brooklyn Dodgers set a modern National League record after tallying four hits in four consecutive games.
Marv Goodwin (one of the few remaining ""spitball"" pitchers) was killed in an accident during an Air Reserve training flight on October 21st. The former right-hander for the St. Louis Cardinals had recently joined the Cincinnati Reds at the end of the season and became the first active-player ever to be killed in a plane crash.
Around the League...
At the annual meeting of American League owners, a plan was adopted to alternate the site of future World Series openers by league rather than deciding it by a coin toss. Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 would be played in one park and 3, 4, and 5 would take place in the other.
On April 5th, New York Yankees icon Babe Ruth collapsed suddenly at a railroad station in Asheville, North Carolina. He later underwent an emergency operation for an ulcer at New York Hospital on April 17th and remained in bed until May 26th.
Baseball legend Christy Mathewson died of tuberculosis on October 7th at Saranac Lake, New York, at the age of forty-five. At the time of his death he was part owner and president of the Boston Braves franchise.
""It seems funny that it (being benched on May 6, 1925) should happen the day after we win and I make two hits. Not that I care about the record (most consecutive games played). When I passed the one-thousand mark, I lost interest in the matter."" - Everett Scott

On May 5, 1925, Ty Cobb told reporters before the game, ""I'll show you something today. I'm going for home runs for the first time in my career."" The thirty-eight year old player / manager went three-for-four versus the St. Louis Browns and had three home runs.
On May 17, 1925, Tom Zachary gave up the 3,000th career hit to Tris Speaker of the Cleveland Indians. On September 30, 1927, Zachary would give up another famous hit though this time it would leave the park and it would be the sixtieth home run slugged by Babe Ruth.
Imagine for a moment if a rookie outfielder hit .370 in this day and age. In 1924, a Tigers' outfielder named Al Wingo; who was playing in his third season, but still a rookie by definition, accomplished that yet he finished third (Ty Cobb hit .378 and Harry Heilmann hit .393) amongst outfielders on the Tigers.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1926 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
U.S. troops were deployed to Nicaragua in May to help restore civil order after a revolt broke out against the new president Emiliano Chamorro. The resulting ""Bryan-Chamorro Treaty"" (terminated in 1970) granted the United States an option for a canal route through the country as well as the installation naval bases. For the majority of the century, Nicaragua's politics had been dominated by the competition for power between the Liberals, who were centered in the city of León, and the Conservatives who were centered in Granada.
Controversial radio host Father Coughlin began broadcasting his right-wing addresses in which he criticized such diverse groups as U.S. bankers, trade unionists, and Communists. Later, he organized the National Union for Social Justice, which denounced President Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" policies and advocated such measures as silver inflation as well as the nationalizing of banks, utilities, and many natural resources. Coughlin also published a magazine titled ""Social Justice"" in which he made increasingly anti-Semitic remarks directed especially at Jewish members of Wall Street.
In the American League...
After eleven seasons (ten-and-a-half years), New York Yankees first baseman Wally Pipp was replaced by an ""up-and-coming"" rookie from Columbia University named Lou Gehrig who would hold the position for 2,130 consecutive games.
Despite losing 11-7 to the Chicago White Sox at Sportsman's Park III on April 22nd, the St. Louis Browns managed to tie an American League record with five double plays.
On April 13th, Washington Senators ace Walter Johnson and Philadelphia Athletics knuckleballer Eddie Rommel met for what is still considered to be the greatest opening-day pitchers' duel in baseball history. After going head-to-head for fifteen grueling innings, Johnson emerged the 1-0 victor after fanning twelve batters.
In the National League...
The Cincinnati Reds used a Major League record-tying eight sacrifices on May 6th, in a 14-1 triumph over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies at Crosley Field.
The city of St. Louis declared May 22nd as ""Rogers Hornsby Day"" to honor the longtime player / manager. The Cardinals presented Hornsby with $1,000 in gold and a medal as the National League MVP for his performance in the 1925 season.
During a September 3rd outing against the Boston Braves, the New York Giants set a National League record after recording an astounding twelve runs in the fifth inning. The mid-game rally devastated the Braves who were unable to recover en route to an embarrassing 17-3 disaster.
Around the League...
The Major League Baseball Rules Committee finally agreed to allow the use of a resin bag by pitchers. The Committee also discussed the elimination of the intentional walk (forcing the pitcher to throw to the batter), as calling a ""catcher balk"" had not eliminated the practice as originally intended.
A nineteen year-old pitching phenomenon named Satchel Paige made his debut on May 1st in the Negro Southern League leading Chattanooga to a 5-4 triumph over Birmingham.
On May 8th, the bleachers along the left field line at Fenway Park were partially destroyed by a fire. Surprisingly, the Red Sox management opted not to replace the seats.
""His (Walter Johnson) fastball looked about the size of a watermelon seed and it hissed at you as it passed."" - Ty Cobb

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1927 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On August 23rd, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts executed two Italian immigrants for a double murder. It was widely believed that the men's reputation as anarchists prevented them from receiving a fair trial and the case remains one of the most controversial in American history. On April 15, 1920, a paymaster for a shoe company in South Braintree, Massachusetts, and his guard were shot and killed by two men who escaped with over $15,000. It was thought from reports of witnesses that the murderers were Italians. The suspects, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were later arrested. Neither, however, had a criminal record, nor was there any evidence of their having had any of the money. In July of 1921, they were found guilty after a trial in Dedham, Massachusetts, and sentenced to death. Years later it was determined that Sacco was probably guilty of the crime, but that Vanzetti was innocent.
American Aviator Charles Lindbergh astounded the world on May 21st by landing in Paris after a solo flight from New York across the Atlantic in ""The Spirit of St. Louis"". Upon his return to the United States he received an unprecedented welcome, was promoted to colonel, and made a nationwide tour to foster popular interest in aviation. Lindbergh later married Anne Morrow, the daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and made several more historic flights with her. After the kidnapping and death of their son in 1932, the Lindberghs moved to England where Charles collaborated with Alexis Carrel on the invention of a perfusion pump that could maintain organs outside the body.
In the American League...
With an all-star lineup known as ""Murderer's Row"", the New York Yankees outscored its opponents by nearly four-hundred runs and hit .307 as a team. Babe Ruth set the original single season mark with sixty home runs which was more than any other American League team had combined. Outfield counterparts, Earle Combs in center and Bob Meusel in left, hit .356 and .337 respectively. Lou Gehrig had his first big season, batting .373 with forty-seven home runs and a league leading one-hundred seventy-five runs batted in. Second year man Tony Lazzeri ranked third in the loop with eighteen home runs.
On May 30th, Washington Senators ace Walter Johnson tossed the final shutout of his career (number one-hundred ten) with a three hit, 3-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox. The ""Big Train"" went on to retire at the end of the season, but eventually returned to the majors as a manager for both the Senators and Cleveland Indians.
In the National League...
On May 3rd, Jess Barnes (Brooklyn Dodgers) and Virgil Barnes (New York Giants) combined for the first match-up in Major League history between two brothers. Jess pitched the last seven innings, surrendering runs in the seventh and eighth, while Virgil allowed twelve hits in the first seven 2/3 innings, and finished with a 7-6 loss.
Chicago Cubs shortstop Jimmy Cooney pulled off a rare unassisted triple play in the opener of a Memorial Day doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Cooney first caught a Paul Waner line drive, then stepped on second to retire brother Lloyd Waner and finally tagged Clyde Barnhart who was attempting to get back on first. Amazingly, the feat would be duplicated the following day by Detroit Tigers first baseman Johnny Nuen against the Cleveland Indians.
Pittsburgh Pirates slugger Paul Waner set a new National League record after finishing fourteen straight games with at least one long hit (twelve doubles, five triples, three home runs). The following day, his twenty-three game hitting streak also came to an end.
Around the League...
During a May 14th game between the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals, a section of ten rows in the right field stands at the Baker Bowl collapsed spilling hundreds of fans onto spectators below. There are many injuries, but the one death that occurred was caused by the crowd's ensuing stampede, not the collapsing bleachers.
The New York Yankees grand finale for the 1927 season, the World Series, was the quickest ever played and lasted only seventy-four hours and fifteen minutes. They became the first American League team to sweep a World Series, and it was only the second four game sweep in World Series history (Braves over Athletics in 1914). The Yankees trailed a total of only two innings during the entire series out scoring the Pirates 23-10. Pittsburgh, only once, managed to score more than one run in an inning (during Game 4).
""Sixty, count 'em, sixty. Let's see some son-of-a-bitch match that."" - Babe Ruth on September 30, 1927

1927 A.L. Team Review
Trivia alert: 1927 was the season where a player hit more home runs than any other team in the league. That player was Babe Ruth, who finished with sixty, and the nearest team was the Washington Senators who finished with fifty-six long balls.
Many fans remember 1927 as the season were Babe Ruth hit sixty home runs, but did you know that on July 4, 1927 Lou Gehrig went deep twice and took over the league lead in home runs? The New York Telegram had ODDS FAVOR GEHRIG TO BEAT OUT RUTH IN HOME RUN DERBY as their next days headlines.
Other notable dates in 1927 included: May 31 - Johnny Neun unassisted triple play, May 31 - Jimmie Foxx hit his first career home run, July 18 - Ty Cobb had career hit number 4,000, August 2 - Walter Johnson Day in Washington D.C., and September 4 - Babe Ruth hit his four-hundredth career home run.

Off the field...
On June 18th, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean during a historic flight that lasted twenty-four hours and forty-nine minutes. The first woman to obtain pilot's certification from the National Aeronautic Association, Earhart flew as a passenger aboard a Fokker F.VIIb-3m flown by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. She later made the first solo flight by a woman from Hawaii to California in 1935, but her plane was later lost somewhere in the Pacific in 1937 as she was attempting to circumnavigate the globe. The exact circumstances of her (presumed) crash are still unknown today.
The Kellogg-Briand Pact was developed as an international effort to outlaw war. The declaration originally started as a bilateral French-American accord, but fourteen nations registered immediately, and sixty-two nations eventually signed. Although unsuccessful, the treaty marked the high point of idealism in the pursuit of peace. The proclamation stated ""Whereas a Treaty between the President of the United States Of America, the President of the German Reich, His Majesty the King of the Belgians, the President of the French Republic, His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, His Majesty the King of Italy, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, the President of the Republic of Poland, and the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.""
In the American League...
On May 1st, the Cleveland Indians outfield tied a Major League record with five assists in a game against the St. Louis Browns. Rookie Sam Langford also tied another Major League mark after posting four of them himself. It was the tenth time (once in extra innings) that the record was equaled in the major leagues, and the last time the century. Although the ""Tribe"" was out-hit 12-10, they managed to hold on for the 4-3 victory.
Forty-one year-old Detroit Tiger veteran Ty Cobb stole home on June 15th against the Cleveland Indians for the fiftieth (and final time) in his twenty-four year career to extend another one of his ninety Major League records.
Washington Senators pitcher Milt Gaston set another unusual American League record after surrendering fourteen hits en route to a 9-0 shutout over the Cleveland Indians on July 10th.
In the National League...
The Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals combined on June 2nd to set a Major League record with a 2-1 effort that was the result of three pinch-hit home runs.
Following a Labor Day doubleheader rainout, the Boston Braves went on to play a record nine consecutive doubleheaders between September 4th and the 15th: First, the Brooklyn Dodgers on the 4th and 5th; then Philadelphia Phillies on the 7th and 8th; followed by the New York Giants on the 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th; and finally the Chicago Cubs on the 15th. Starting with Philadelphia, the Braves also went on to set an unwanted record by dropping five consecutive games including all four against the Giants.
On September 18th, the Boston Braves and Chicago Cubs combined to set a National League record with eight double plays between them.
Around the League...
After voters in Massachusetts finally approved Sunday baseball in Boston (provided that the ballpark is more than 1,000 feet from a church), Pennsylvania was left as the only state in the major leagues with no Sunday baseball.
Alfred J. Reach, founder of A.J. Reach Sporting Goods, died on January 14th at the tender age of eighty-seven. Reach had become the first ballplayer ever to receive a regular salary after signing as a catcher with the Philadelphia Athletics at $25 a week (for expenses) in 1865.
On December 11th, National League President John Heydler first proposed (see newspaper story at bottom of page) the concept of a designated hitter (also known as the tenth regular). Heydler contended that the fans were tired of seeing weak hitting pitchers come up to bat and the incorporation of a designated hitter would improve the quality of play and speed up the game.
""Never again will I be an active player. I'm just baseball tired and want to quit."" - Ty Cobb on September 17, 1928

On June 15, 1928, Ty Cobb hit a double off George Grant during the eighth inning. A soft grounder moved Cobb to third where he waited patiently before stealing home plate for the fifty-fourth time during his career.
On July 21, 1928, Jimmie Foxx hit a home run an estimated 460 feet off Jack Ogden. The blast was the first ever hit out of Shibe Park without first bouncing on the roof.

Baseball and politics have always been intertwined and things were no different in 1928. On the 1st day of September, a Republican candidate named Herbert Hoover showed up at the Senators versus Yankees game to pose with Babe Ruth who was heard by the media saying, ""Nothing doing, I'm for Al Smith.""

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1929 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
One February evening in north Chicago, seven well-dressed men were found riddled with bullets inside the S.M.C Cartage Company garage. All had been lined up against a wall, with their backs to their executioners (who were disguised as policemen) and shot to death. The men were mobsters working under the leadership of gangster and bootlegger, ""Bugs"" Moran and were casualties of what would become the ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"". Ordered by rival gang leader, Al ""Scarface"" Capone, the notorious attack was carried out by Jack ""Machine Gun"" McGurn who had organized the hit. Thanks to prohibition, Capone had become the crime czar of Chicago, running gambling, prostitution and bootlegging rackets while continuously expanding his territories by getting rid of rival gangs.
Stock market prices plummeted from November to December and U.S. securities lost $26 billion, marking the first financial disaster of the Great Depression. The American depression produced severe effects abroad, especially in Europe, where many countries had not fully recovered from the aftermath of World War I. In Germany, the economic disaster and resulting social dislocation contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Although it shared the basic characteristics of other such crises, the Great Depression was unprecedented in its length and in the wholesale poverty and tragedy it inflicted on society.
In the American League...
The first-place Philadelphia Athletics scored a whopping eight runs off of Boston Red Sox pitcher Milt Gaston on the way to an embarrassing 24-6 massacre at Fenway Park on May 1st. The twenty-four runs matched a franchise record previously set in the ""Ty Cobb protest game"" in 1912, and the twenty-nine hits set another franchise mark.
The Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers set a major league ""marathon"" record on May 24th after going twenty-one innings (three hours and thirty-one minutes) for the longest game ever seen to date at Comiskey Park. George Uhle emerged the 6-5 winner, after going twenty innings, with Vic Sorrell finishing in relief. The loser, Ted Lyons, went the distance giving up a respectable twenty-four hits (over twenty-one innings).
In the National League...
On April 29th, Brooklyn Dodgers relief pitcher Clise Dudley became the first player ever to hit a home run against the first pitch he saw. Claude Willoughby of the Philadelphia Phillies gave up the inaugural round-tripper en route to an 8-3 victory. Amazingly Dudley would go on to hit only two more home runs in his four Major League years.
The Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds turned an amazing nine double plays on July 3rd to tie the Major League double-play mark previously set in 1925 by Detroit and Washington.
The St. Louis Cardinals answered back after losing 10-6 in the opener of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies with a magnificent 28-6 victory on July 6th. The ""Redbirds"" came out swinging in game two and collected ten runs in the first and ten more in the fifth. Their twenty-eight hits and twenty-eight runs set a National League record and both teams combined to tie a Major League title with seventy-three hits in a doubleheader.
Around the League...
The New York Yankees announced that they were adding numbers on the backs of their uniforms. Initially, continuous numbers were distributed based upon a player's position in the batting order (Combs #1, Koenig #2, Ruth #3, Gehrig #4, Meusel #5, Lazzeri #6, Durocher #7, Grabowski #8). Several weeks later, the Cleveland Indians agreed to follow suite and by 1931 all American League teams were utilizing the new identification technique. However, some National League players still remained numberless until 1933.
On August 3rd, the Chicago Cubs voiced their complaint about the ragged sleeve on the pitching arm of Brooklyn Dodger ace Dazzy Vance (an old trick to distract the hitter). Soon after, a Major League rule was passed that required all pitchers to maintain neat attire. The mandate would expand over the years to include caps, gloves, glasses and other visual deterrents.
The New York Giants used the first public address system in a big-league ballpark during a July 5th game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
On September 25th, New York Yankees manager Miller Huggins died from accidental blood poisoning at New York's St. Vincent Hospital at the age of forty-nine. On the day of his funeral in Cincinnati, the American League canceled all games. Yankees coach Art Fletcher remained, as interim skipper, and Bob Shawkey was brought in as the official manager for the 1930 season.
""I have always wanted to pitch in the World Series Mr. Mack. There is one great game left in this old arm."" - Howard Ehmke

On Opening Day in 1929 the Cleveland Indians became the first American League team to wear uniform numbers on their backs onto the field. The Yankees, who had a rain delay in New York, were the first to permanently add numbers to their uniforms on this same date.
On May 13, 1929, two teams with uniform numbers on their backs faced off for the first time in Major League history. The Indians won that historic game in League Park versus the Yankees 4-3.
The founding member of the 500 Home Runs Club made it official on August 11, 1929 — review the box score for complete details of that legendary game.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1930 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Economics dominated politics in the 1930s and the decade began with the construction of shanty towns called ""Hoovervilles"" (named after a president who felt that relief should be left to the private sector) and ended with a series of federal programs funded by the national government and an assortment of commissions set up to regulate Wall Street, the banking industry, and other business enterprises.
The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Hoover who desired a limited upward revision of tariff rates with general increases on farm products and industrial rates. The controversial act brought retaliatory tariffs from many foreign countries causing U.S. foreign trade to suffer while intensifying America's economic depression.
Many of America's most distinguished writers produced works of fiction during the thirties. The list includes such names as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thornton Wilder. Some of the novels of this period explored what was happening in America during the Great Depression. One standout, John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"", chronicled the life of a displaced Oklahoma family who had lost its farm to the drought of the Dust Bowl.
In the American League...
During an April 27th, 2-1 victory over the St. Louis Browns, Chicago White Sox first baseman Bud Clancy became the first player at his position since Al McCauley of Washington (American Association) in 1891 to have no chances in a nine-inning game.
The New York Yankees' and Detroit Tigers' outfields combined on May 9th for a meager two putouts setting an American League record that has never been equaled. The National League record for outfielder idleness was previously set at one putout when the Pittsburgh Pirates took on the ""Brooklyn Superbas"" back in August of 1910.
On May 11th, Cleveland Indians outfielder Bibb Falk accomplished true offensive symmetry after collecting five hits, five runs batted in and five runs (in the first five innings) during a 25-7 massacre over the Philadelphia Athletics.
In the National League...
New York Giants pitcher Larry Benton set an unwanted modern Major League record (since tied several times) by surrendering six separate home runs in a single game. Training the Chicago Cubs 14-4, Benton and his teammates managed to tack on five runs (on four home runs) in the bottom of the seventh to tie the Major League record for most runs in a side.
The rules governing homeruns was changed after Brooklyn Dodgers catcher Al Lopez bounced one over Cincinnati Reds' left fielder Bob Meusel and into the bleachers on September 12th. The lucky round-tripper marked the last recorded ""bouncer"" and has since then been marked as a guaranteed double.
On the final day of the regular season, a young nineteen-year-old rookie named Dizzy Dean made his Major League debut with St. Louis Cardinals surrendering just 3-hits en route to a 3-1 victory over the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates.
Around the League...
On March 8th, Babe Ruth signed a new two year contract for $160,000 with the New York Yankees. At $80,000 per year, ""The Sultan of Swat"" became the highest paid player of all time and earned more money than the President of the United States. In an effort to assure posterity, Yankees General Manager Ed Barrow was quoted as saying that ""No one in baseball will ever be paid more than Ruth.""
By April 29th, suspicions that the 1930 ball was the ""liveliest ever"" increase as an astounding one-hundred twenty-three runs were scored in just seven Major League games.
With no Most Valuable Player Award for the second year in a row (due to financial strains), the Associated Press polled its members and named Joe Cronin as it's unofficial American League MVP for 1930. The Baseball Writers Association named Hack Wilson the MVP of the Nationals and his team (the Chicago Cubs) presented him with the $1000 bonus. The Sporting News, also acting to fill the MVP void, announced its own selection of Bill Terry as the Most Valuable Player for the National League, and Joe Cronin for the American League.
On November 23rd, Red Badgro, a St. Louis Browns outfielder / New York Giants receiver caught his third touchdown pass of the season (against the Green Bay Packers) igniting a two-sport career that would eventually land him in the Football Hall of Fame in 1981.
""You'll (Waite Hoyt) pitch the way I tell you to or you won't pitch for me at all (Hoyt was traded on May 30, 1930)."" - Yankee Manager Bob Shawkey

On May 12, 1930, Milt Shoffner became the first pitcher in history to balk three times during the same inning — third inning versus the Athletics.
On June 13, 1930, two previous batting champions were traded for one another for the first time ever. Those two batting champions were Goose Goslin and Heinie Manush and we invite you to examine their batting titles.
Have you ever seen a triple steal? If you could have seen the Athletics play the Indians on July 25, 1930 you would have seen the A's turn two. The first took place in the first inning, the second took place in the fourth inning, both were successful, and the A's won 14-1.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1931 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Organized Crime icon Al Capone was finally convicted by a grand jury and sentenced to eleven years in prison for tax evasion. The American gangster had repeatedly escaped prosecution even after being implicated in multiple murders and had received numerous accolades from businessmen and politicians. His crime syndicate, which terrorized Chicago in the 1920s while controlling gambling and prostitution, was estimated by the federal Bureau of Internal Revenue to have taken in $105 million in 1927 alone.
""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was officially made the national anthem by Congress, although it already had been adopted as such by the U.S. Armed Forces. On Sept. 13, 1814, Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet in Chesapeake Bay to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes, who had been captured after the burning of Washington, DC. Key was forced to seek shelter onboard a ship overnight during the shelling of Fort McHenry in Baltimore. In the morning, he was so delighted to see the American flag still flying over the fort that he began a poem to commemorate the occasion.
In the American League...
The Major League record for catching fly balls was set during a June 29th doubleheader between Detroit and Philadelphia. On the way to both 9-1 and 5-1 victories, the Tiger's outfielders boasted twenty-four putouts and the Athletics answered back with nineteen of their own for a two-team total of forty-three fly-outs in two games.
On July 7th, the St. Louis Browns and Chicago White Sox met for a twelve inning marathon in which not a single strikeout was recorded. The 10-8 decision still remains the longest game in Major League history not to record a single ""K"".
Philadelphia Athletics ace Lefty Grove (25-2) recorded a 4-2 win over the Chicago White Sox on August 9th for his sixteenth consecutive victory to tie an American League record originally set by Walter Johnson and Joe Wood in 1912.
In the National League...
Chicago Cubs player / manager, Rogers Hornsby, inserted himself into the line-up on April 24th and hit three consecutive home runs to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 10-6 at Forbes Field. Hornsby went on to lead the Cubs into third place (while batting .331), but was eventually fired due to a lifelong compulsion with gambling that had landed him in debt.
Wally Berger, the Boston Braves centerfielder who had established two National League rookie records with thirty-eight home runs and one-hundred nineteen runs batted in during 1930, tied a modern mark for the outfield by recording four assists during a Socks Seibold 2-0 shutout over the Philadelphia Phillies on April 27th.
Pittsburgh Pirates' outfielder Adam Comorosky proved that lightning could strike twice after making an unassisted double play on May 31st against the Chicago Cubs and another double player on June 13th against the New York Giants.
Around the League...
On February 15th, the New York Yankees' spring training facility in St. Petersburg, Florida was officially renamed ""Miller Huggins Field"" in honor of the team's late manager.
The Chicago White Sox and New York Giants met for the first major league night game (at Buffs Stadium, Houston Texas) on February 21st. Both teams combined to collect twenty-three hits during the ten-inning exhibition.
On April 2nd, a seventeen-year-old female named Jackie Mitchell from the Double A ""Chattanooga Lookouts"" took the mound against the mighty New York Yankees in a spring training exhibition. Mitchell, mainly a ""gate attraction"", boasted a single pitch, which was a wicked, dropping curve ball. The first two batters she faced from ""Murderers Row"" were Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. After seven pitches Mitchell fanned the ""Sultan of Swat"" AND the ""Iron Horse,"" back-to-back.
""I went in and tore the clubhouse up - wrecked the place, tore those stall lockers off the wall and everything else (after ending his 16 game winning streak on August 23, 1931 with a loss to St. Louis)."" - Lefty Grove

On April 26, 1931, Lou Gehrig lost a home run from his career total when the ball bounced back onto the field, was fielded by Sam Rice of the Senators, and thrown back towards the infielders. Lyn Lary, who was on first base, thought the ball was caught so after rounding third he headed into the dugout. Gehrig touched home (passing the runner), was called out, and credited by the official scorer with a triple costing him a home run and eventually the exclusive home run title for the 1931 season.
Every fan knows who hit the most home runs during a single season. But, do you know which pitcher hit the most home runs during a season? That Major League record belongs to Wes Ferrell of the Cleveland Indians who slammed nine during the 1931 season.
Significant dates in 1931 included: August 8 - Bobby Burke no hitting the Red Sox, August 18 - Lou Gehrig's 1,000th consecutive game, and August 21 - Babe Ruth's 600th career home run.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1932 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Charles A. Lindbergh, the American aviator who made the first solo, nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris, faced every parent's nightmare after his child was kidnapped and murdered. In March, Lindberg's son was abducted from his own bedroom with a ransom demand of $50,000 for his release. After paying the sum, Lindberg's son was not returned infuriating the country and sparking one of the largest manhunts in modern history. In September, the missing child's battered body was found near Hopewell and further investigation revealed a suspect named Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who was found in possession of the ransom. In a sensational trial at Flemington, New Jersey, Hauptmann was convicted of murder and electrocuted on April 3rd, 1936.
In the American League...
On May 16th, the New York Yankees recorded their fourth straight shutout to equal the American League record set by both Cleveland and Boston in 1903 and 1906. The Pinstripes ""perfect rotation"" included Johnny Allen, George Pipgras, Red Ruffing, and Lefty Gomez who combined for an 8-0 triumph over the Indians.
Lou Gehrig, of the New York Yankees, tallied four consecutive homeruns during a 20-13 slugfest against the Philadelphia Athletics on June 3rd. Teammate Tony Lazzeri hit for the cycle and the Bronx Bombers also set a Major League record with forty-one extra bases.
Washington Senators third baseman Ossie Bluege tied the American League record after being walked five times in the first game of a doubleheader that was eventually won by the Detroit Tigers 8-6.
In the National League...
First baseman Bill Terry tied a National League record on April 17th with twenty-one putouts as the New York Giants topped the Boston Braves 6-0 at the Polo Grounds.
Pittsburgh standout Paul Waner tied a Major League mark with four doubles in five at bats as the Pirates topped the St. Louis Cardinals 5-0 on May 20th. Waner would later go on to break Chuck Klein's National League record for most doubles in a season with sixty-two.
John Quinn of the Brooklyn Dodgers became the oldest pitcher (at forty-nine) to win a Major League baseball game after relieving Van Mungo in the ninth to beat the New York Giants 2-1 on August 14th. Teammate Johnny Frederick had tied the game with his fourth pinch-hit homerun of the year setting a new major league record and would go on to add two more before the season's end.
Around the League...
On May 30th, a commemorative plaque in memory of former Yankee manager Miller Huggins was dedicated at Yankee Stadium initiating an array of tributes that would later evolve into ""Monument Park"".
At a June 22nd meeting of the National League club presidents, a committee finally approved the addition of numbers on player uniforms. The American League's New York Yankees had initiated the concept in 1929 with the rest of the American League following close behind.
After holding several hearings, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis cleared Rogers Hornsby on charges of fraudulently ""borrowing"" money from several Chicago Cubs players. The investigation was initiated after local papers in the ""Windy City"" reported that Hornsby had obtained money from players to bet on horse races or to share in joint ventures.
During a joint meeting of American and National League owners on December 15th, the concept of ""chain store"" baseball (originally developed as the St. Louis Cardinal farm system) was approved despite objections by Judge Landis.
""I believe the greatest team I ever saw was the 1932 Yankees."" - Hall of Famer Billy Herman

1932 American League Team Review
Here is a list of every single rookie who made their debut in the American League in 1936, and here is a list of every single American League player who retired in 1936. Lou Gehrig, not a rookie, and not about to retire, became the first American League player to hit four home runs during the same game on June 3, 1932 — review the box score for complete details.
On July 31, 1932, Municipal Stadium hosted its first game. 80,184 fans sat in the $2.64 million dollar stadium and watched the Athletics' Lefty Grove shutout the Indians 1-0.
On September 13, 1932, Joe McCarthy clinched the American League pennant while at the helm of the New York Yankees making him the first manager to win pennants in both the American and National leagues.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1933 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The legal prevention of alcoholic beverages known as ""Prohibition"" was finally repealed due to the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment. After World War I, national prohibition had become the law as stated in the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which strictly forbid the manufacturing, sale, import, or export of any and all intoxicating liquors. In spite of the Volstead Act (1919), law enforcement proved to be very difficult and smuggling (or bootlegging) on a large scale could not be prevented. As a result, the illicit manufacture of liquor sprang up with such rapidity that authorities were unable to suppress it.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt initiated his ""New Deal"" domestic reform program. The first phase (1933-34) attempted to provide recovery and relief from the Great Depression through programs of agricultural and business regulation, inflation, price stabilization, and public works. As a result, Congress established numerous emergency organizations, notably the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the Public Works Administration.
In the American League...
During a May 16th marathon at Griffith Stadium, the Washington Senators and Cleveland Indians both combined to break a Major League record by using eleven different pitchers in twelve innings. With both bullpens depleted, the Senators finally broke through the stalemate for the 11-10 decision.
On August 14th, Philadelphia Athletics slugger Jimmie Foxx hit for the cycle against the Cleveland Indians while driving in nine runs for a new American League record. Eight players amazingly would hit for the cycle during the 1933 season.
New York Yankees icon Babe Ruth returned to the mound on October 1st to pitch the final outing of his career. Adding a homerun to support his own cause, ""The Bambino"" finished the complete game with a 6-5 victory over his old teammates (and rivals) the Boston Red Sox.
In the National League...
Honus Wagner left retirement to rejoin the Pittsburgh Pirates as a coach. Wagner had previously played seventeen years with the ball club and would remain for thirty-nine more while giving batting tips to future Hall of Famers Pie Traynor, Kiki Cuyler, Arky Vaughn, Ralph Kiner, and the Waner brothers.
On March 11th, a substantial earthquake rocked the Los Angeles area interrupting an exhibition game between the Chicago Cubs and New York Giants. As fans exited the grandstands amidst panic, players from both teams were forced to huddle around the center of the diamond until the tremors stopped.
Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Dick Bartell equaled a Major League mark on April 25th with four doubles in four at bats during a 7-1 victory over the Boston Braves at the Baker Bowl.
Around the League...
Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis took a voluntary pay-cut of forty percent setting an example for the league-wide salary cuts that were anticipated due to the lingering Depression.
The All-Star Game made its debut on July 6th 1933, at Chicago's Comiskey Park. It was initiated at the insistence of Arch Ward, a sports editor for the Chicago Tribune, to coincide with the celebration of Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition. The National League's manager John McGraw and American Leagues's Connie Mack were chosen to lead a line-up of big hitters including Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Babe Ruth. With fellow All-Star, Charlie Gehringer on first in the bottom of the third, Ruth drove one into the right-field stands for the first homer in All-Star history. The rest of the American Leaguers followed suite and went on to beat the Nationals in the inaugural Midsummer Classic 4-2.
""I'm not a headline guy. I know that as long as I was following (Babe) Ruth to the plate I could have stood on my head and no one would have known the difference."" - Lou Gehrig

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1934 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
American justice prevailed as Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker aka ""Bonnie and Clyde"" were ambushed and killed instantly by a posse of lawmen led by Texas Ranger Frank Hamer near Sailes, Bienville Parish, Louisiana on May 23rd. Together the pair committed thirteen murders, numerous kidnappings, and several burglaries and robberies requiring the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to engage in the largest manhunt the United States had seen up to that time. Another famous bank robber and cold-blooded killer who terrorized the Midwest during the early '30s, John Dillinger was also shot and killed by FBI agents outside of a Chicago movie theater in July.
The Securities and Exchange Commission agency of the U.S. government was created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and was charged with protecting the interests of the public and investors in connection with the public issuance and sale of corporate securities. The Federal Communications Commission was also established to regulate interstate and foreign communications in the public interest.
In the American League...
Washington Senators reserve catcher Moe Berg set an American League record on April 21st, after playing in his one-hundred seventeenth consecutive errorless game (dating back to 1931).
New York Yankees icon Lou Gehrig hit two home runs (one a grand slam) and a pair of doubles on May 10th, to tie the Major League record with four long hits and seven runs (in only five innings of play) to top the Chicago White Sox, 13-3.
The amazingly inconsistent St. Louis Browns shocked everyone on June 3rd after tying an American League record for most consecutive hits (nine in the sixth-inning — all with two outs) to beat the first place Cleveland Indians 12-8.
In the National League...
On April 29th, the Pittsburgh Pirates became the last remaining major league city to play a home outing on a Sunday (beating the Cincinnati Reds 9-5) after the state's ""Blue Law"" (prohibiting games on Sundays) was repealed.
St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Dazzy Vance notched the two-thousandth strikeout of his career during his last complete game, a 4-2 victory over the Boston Braves, on July 22nd.
Reggie Grabowski of the Philadelphia Phillies, set an unwanted National League record after surrendering eleven hits (and runs) in the ninth inning against the New York Giants for a humiliating 21-4 loss on August 4th.
Around the League...
Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was granted absolute power in 1920 after the Black Sox scandal had tainted the game, denied participant Shoeless Joe Jackson's appeal for reinstatement in January.
Due to declining attendance, both the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns discontinued radio broadcasts from Sportsman's Park in an effort to promote ticket sales with the hometown fans. All games had been aired since 1926, but only on weekdays for the last two years.
As a novelty concept (that would eventually catch on), fans were tasked with voting in the participants for the second annual All-Star Game, which was to be played on July 10th at the Polo Grounds in New York. Bill Terry of the New York Giants was the top vote-getter in the Midsummer Classic balloting.
Negro League ace Satchel Paige tossed a 4-0 no-hitter on July 4th against the Homestead Grays in Pittsburgh, and then drove to Chicago to shut out the Chicago American Giants 1-0 (in twelve innings) giving him two shutouts (in two different cities) on the same day.
""Whatever Lou (Gehrig) does in the future doesn't count. He has had fourteen great seasons, and I mean great. If I could have only ten of them, I'd be satisfied."" - Lou Gehrig

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1945 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After several days of street-to-street combat in Berlin and the suicide of Nazi leader Adolph Hitler, Germany finally agreed to an unconditional surrender marking the end of the European campaign of World War II. The conflict lasted five years, eight months, and six days, and cost millions of lives, including six million Jews and twenty million soldiers and civilians killed in the U.S.S.R. alone.
In an effort to hasten the Pacific campaign, the United States Air Force dropped the world's first Atomic Bomb on Hiroshima, destroying the entire city and killing over seventy-thousand people. Three days later a second bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki with similar results. Realizing that further resistance was futile, the Japanese government finally agreed to terms of surrender aboard the Battleship U.S.S. Missouri in Tokyo Harbor marking the absolute end of WWII.
In the American League...
Pete Gray of the St. Louis Browns became the first ""physically challenged"" Major League ballplayer. Despite the loss of his right arm in a childhood accident, Gray had learned to field, throw and bat solely with his left. He quickly built a reputation for hitting clutch, line drives around the field and also exhibited fearless speed and daring on the base paths. As a testament to overcoming adversity, his fielding technique was a study in both agility and dexterity. After catching a fly ball, the outfielder would tuck his thinly padded glove under his stump; roll the ball across his chest, and throw it to the cut-off man in one fluid motion.
Red Sox rookie Boo Ferriss set an American League record after pitching twenty-two consecutive shut out innings for the most scoreless innings at the start of a Major League career. His streak finally ended on May 13th after he allowed one earned run against the Detroit Tigers en route to a 6-2 victory.
In the National League...
On April 17th, New York Giants player-manager Mel Ott set several records during his team's 11-6 win over the Boston Braves. In nine-innings, Ott collected a double, two walks and three runs to achieve several career marks (for a single player with one team) including one-thousand twenty-six extra-base hits, two-thousand seventy-six total bases, one-thousand seven-hundred seventy-eight RBIs, one-thousand seven-hundred eighty-seven runs and one-thousand six-hundred thirty-one walks.
The Boston Braves swept a July 6th double header against the Pittsburgh Pirates 13-5 and 14-8 as Tommy Holmes hit in his thirty-fourth consecutive game to pass the previous streak of thirty-three set by Rogers Hornsby in 1922.
""Joe D's"" older and less-famous brother Vince DiMaggio tied a Major League record after hitting his fourth grand slam of the season during an 8-3 Philadelphia Phillies victory over the Boston Braves on September 1st. Unfortunately, DiMaggio would not get an opportunity to break the record as an injury would keep him out for the rest of the season.
Around the League...
Major League owners decided to cancel the 1945 All-Star Game due to wartime travel restrictions. Eight simultaneous games were scheduled in place of the Midsummer Classic pitting the National and American Leagues against one another in interleague play.
Billy Southworth Jr., the first player in organized baseball to enlist for military service in WWII, died on February 15th after his B-29 Superfortress crashed off the coast of Flushing, New York. The twenty-seven year-old combat veteran had flown twenty-five successful missions in Europe and was the son of St. Louis Cardinals manager Billy Southworth.
Despite the depletion of quality rosters around the league due to wartime commitments, attendance in ballparks across the majors rose to a staggering 10.28 million, breaking the 1940 record. The Detroit Tigers topped the list with 1.28 million and the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, and Chicago Cubs came in a close second with one million fans each.
On October 23rd, Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey announced the signing of Jackie Robinson as the first African-American to play in the Major Leagues. Over the course of a distinguished ten year career, Robinson went go on to lead the Dodgers to six National League titles and one World Series championship. A man of many ""firsts"", Robinson also became the first black player to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.
""Hal Newhouser is the only pitcher in major league history to win back-to-back Most Valuable Player Awards (1944 and 1945). His blazing fastball made him a strikeout king."" - National Baseball Hall of Fame

Pete Gray, who had only one arm and was Baseball Almanac's first ever Autograph of the Week recipient, made his Major League debut on April 18, 1945.
Interleague play in 1945? Yes, it actually took place. The All-Star Game was cancelled in 1945 due to flight restrictions and on July 10th and 11th each team faced off in what would be the first non-post season interleague contests.
On July 1, 1945, Hank Greenberg became the first Major League player to return from the war and play in a game. The legendary Tiger has been away from Major League ballparks for more than four years, but still hit a home run during his first game back.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1946 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
John William Mauchly designed the first all-electronic computer for the U.S. Department of Army Ordnance to help compute ballistic firing tables. The revolutionary device, called the ENIAC, weighed thirty tons and consisted of thirty separate units that were cooled by a crude, forced-air system. The all ""digital"" computer operated on 19,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors that consumed almost 200 kilowatts of electrical power.
Dr. Benjamin Spock published his first book ""The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care"" with a dramatic contrast to earlier child-care guides that favored rigid schedules and warned against showing a child too much affection. Dr. Spock's book was reassuring in its support of maternal tenderness and went on to sell 25,000,000 copies while revolutionizing parenting in the United States and abroad.
In the American League...
The New York Yankees became the first Major League Baseball team to fly on a regular basis after leasing a United Airlines plane nicknamed the ""Yankee Mainliner"". Despite the convenience of a shortened travel schedule, four players, including Red Ruffing, still elected to take the train.
Boston Red Sox second baseman Johnny Pesky became the first American League player to single-handedly score six runs in a game during a 14-10 triumph over the Chicago White Sox on May 8th for their thirteenth straight victory. Boston extended its streak to fifteen games before losing to their rivals, the New York Yankees, on May 11th.
The American League All-Stars embarrassed the National's representatives with a 12-0 triumph at Fenway Park. Despite the lop-sided finale, this particular Midsummer Classic remained special, as the '45 event had been cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions. Many players later stated that they had never seen a more festive occasion and many of them had not seen their major league rivals in several years. ""Home field"" slugger Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox led the charge with two home runs, two singles, a walk, four runs scored and four runs batted in.
In the National League...
On March 17th, the Brooklyn Dodgers played an exhibition game in Daytona Beach against their own Minor League farm team, the Montreal Royals. With Jackie Robinson in the line-up, it marked the first appearance of an integrated baseball team during the 20th century. As a fitting tribute, the field was later renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in honor of the man who broke through baseball's color barrier.
On May 20th, Chicago Cubs ace Claude Passeau made his first error since 1941 to end an all-time pitcher's fielding streak of two-hundred seventy-three consecutive errorless chances. Passeau was noted for playing with a special modified glove due to a deformed left hand that was disfigured by a childhood shooting accident.
The Pittsburgh Pirates voted 20-16 in favor of a walkout (prior to a game against the New York Giants) in order to gain recognition of the American Baseball Guild. According to league policy however, a two-thirds majority vote was required to ""legally"" initiate a strike. Despite being unsuccessful, the players had made a statement in direct support of the newly established coalition that had yet to be acknowledged by the league. As a prelude to the Players Association, the guild had proposed the increase of the leagues' minimum salary to $7,500 as well as a formal arbitration policy for all future salary disputes.
Around the League...
The Chicago White Sox became the first Major League team to provide an official Media Guide for the baseball writers. The seventeen-page publication had been developed by Marsh Samuel and listed individual player and team information as well as limited statistical data. Bill Veeck was so impressed by the concept; he hired Samuel himself to develop a similar guide for the Cleveland Indians.
The Detroit Tigers, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Athletics and Phillies all refused to raise their standard ticket fare while the rest of the league upped their costs considerably with $2.50 for boxes, $1.25 for general admission and .60 cents for outfield bleachers.
Fortune magazine published a study into the finances of Major League Baseball that included a detailed report on the New York Yankees franchise. As a sign of things to come, the Bronx Bombers posted league high revenues of $306,000 that were cut to $201,000 following Minor League losses. Of their overall gross income, $896,000 came from home ticket sales. Despite playing poorly, the Yanks completed their home season with a record attendance of 2,309,029. The best previous draw was credited to the Chicago Cubs who boasted 1,485,166 fans in 1929.
On Friday, August 9th, all games (four each for both the American and National Leagues) were played at night for the first time in Major League history.
""A manager who cannot get along with a .400 hitter ought to have his head examined."" - Joe McCarthy on September 29, 1946

On April 30, 1946, Bob Feller of Cleveland no-hit the New York Yankees 1-0 in front of 38,112 fans. However, did you know that it was the first time the Bronx Bombers had been no-hit at Yankee Stadium?
On July 14, 1946, Lou Boudreau of the Cleveland Indians told the media, ""We had to do something"" after losing to the Boston Red Sox in a doubleheader. Boudreau was speaking about the first appearance of the Boudreau Shift which took place during game two. The famous defensive maneuver was used against Ted Williams and it featured six players moving to the right side of second base and the left fielder being repositioned at shortstop (making him the only player left of second base). Williams stepped out of the batters box when faced with the unusual defense, made a humorous gesture, then promptly hit a double down the right field line.
Ted Williams wrote in My Turn At Bat, ""Someone said, 'Is that the easiest homer you ever got?' And I said, 'Hell no, it was the hardest. I had to run."" The hardest home run of his career occurred on September 13, 1946, when he hit a ball past the left-fielder who was playing shortstop in the new Boudreau Shift maneuver. The first inning inside-the-park-home-run was the only run scored by the Boston Red Sox who defeated the Cleveland Indians 1-0 and clinched the American League pennant.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1947 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Captain Chuck Yaeger, an American test pilot, became the first to break the sound barrier after he accelerated his X-1 test plane to six-hundred seventy miles per hour, at an altitude of 42,000 feet. The specially designed aircraft was dropped from a modified B-29 bomber leftover from World War II.
Secretary of State George C. Marshall announced the goals of his Economic Recovery Plan, otherwise known as ""The Marshall Plan"" which stated that ""the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world"". The idea of providing aid in the reconstruction of war torn nations provided markets for American goods, created reliable trading partners, and supported the development of stable democratic governments in Western Europe. Congress's approval of the Marshall Plan signaled an extension of the bipartisanship of World War II into the postwar years.
In the American League...
Philadelphia Athletics catcher Buddy Rosar finally dropped a pop-up on May 20th for his first recorded error in one-hundred forty-seven games and seven-hundred fifty-six chances. New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra went on to extend the Major League record to one-hundred forty-eight and nine-hundred fifty from 1957 to 1959, but Rosar's single-season record of one-hundred fifteen games and six-hundred five errorless chances stood unchallenged for fifty years until Charles Johnson of the Florida Marlins topped it in 1997.
Larry Doby became the first African-American to play in the American League after appearing as a pinch-hitter for the Cleveland Indians on July 5th during a 6-5 loss to the Chicago White Sox. The following day he started at first base and went one-for-five at the plate.
On August 13th, Willard Brown of the St. Louis Browns became the first African-American player to homer in the American League after hitting a pinch inside-the-park home run for a 6-5 victory over pitcher Hal Newhouser and the Detroit Tigers.
In the National League...
On April 17th, the Brooklyn Dodgers topped the Boston Braves at Ebbets Field 12-6, as baseball's first African-American player; Jackie Robinson tallied his first Major League hit (a bunt single). Robinson would go on to perfect the ""squeeze play"" while bunting forty-two times throughout the season.
Johnny Mize of the New York Giants set a Major League record after hitting three successive home runs (for the fifth time in his career) during a 14-5 loss to the Boston Braves. Mize would later go on to add a sixth, three-homer performance while playing with the New York Yankees in 1950.
After several St. Louis Cardinal players were rumored to initiate a strike as a sign of protest against playing with Jackie Robinson, National League President Ford Frick and team owner Sam Breadon both announced that any player directly involved in any acts of racial prejudice or disobedience would be suspended indefinitely. Cardinal manager Eddie Dyer wholeheartedly denied the allegations and his ""Redbirds"" went on to play (and beat) the Brooklyn Dodgers 5-1.
Around the League...
Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler announced the development of the first official pension plan for major leaguers. The plan stated that any player with five years experience would receive a check for $50 a month at age fifty, and $10 a month over the next five years. The pension fund was initially set up for $650,000, with teams providing 80% and the players investing the remaining 20%.
April 27th was declared as ""Babe Ruth Day"" at all Major League ballparks. During a special pre-game ceremony at Yankee Stadium, a frail looking Ruth, who was battling the effects of throat cancer, struggled through a short speech thanking the fans for their continued support. The emotional program was broadcast nationwide on television, radio and over the loudspeakers at every stadium as ""The Bambino"" was presented with a bronze plaque with his likeness from the American League and a leather-bound book with signatures of every player from the National League.
Tragedy struck the Minor League system as standout Jimmy Davis (Longhorn League) died after being hit in the head with a pitched ball. The promising twenty-year old outfielder was hitting .333 at the time and had tallied nineteen home runs in forty-eight games.
New York Yankees slugger Joe DiMaggio was named the American League's MVP by a single point over the Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams. Williams, the Triple Crown winner, received two-hundred one points, but was completely left off one writer's ballot igniting a major controversy. It was later determined that a single, tenth-place vote (or better) would have granted him the two points that were necessary to top DiMaggio.

On July 5, 1947, Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians became the first black player to appear in an American League game. Doby debuted against the Chicago White Sox during the seventh inning as a pinch hitter for pitcher Bryan Stephens. With two on, and two out, Doby struck out against Earl Harrist.
Despite breaking the color barrier two months after the senior circuit, the American League would be involved in several other racially significant games: July 20, 1947, St. Louis Browns (Hank Thompson and Willard Brown) versus the Red Sox in the first game where two black players appeared in the same lineup; August 9, 1947, Cleveland Indians (Larry Doby) versus the St. Louis Browns (Hank Thompson) in the first game where two black players opposed each other; and August 11, 1947, St. Louis Browns' Willard Brown became the first black player to hit an inside the park home run.
On September 28, 1947, the St. Louis Browns were playing the Chicago White Sox. In the broadcast booth preparing to call the game was the legendary Dizzy Dean who quipped he could still beat ""nine out of ten who call themselves pitchers today."" Challenged to prove it, Dean left the booth, started the game for the Browns, and tossed four shutout innings. Upon resuming his broadcast duties he commented, ""I think I could pitch well enough to win up here (in the booth), but I don't intend to try!""

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1948 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After supporting the idea of a Jewish independent state, the United States officially recognized Israel, as its own entity. President Truman made a formal announcement fourteen minutes after the state had been declared in Tel Aviv. Shortly after, the surrounding Arab States attacked Israel sparking off a religious conflict that has lasted to this day.
Edwin Herbert, an American physicist and inventor, debuted the first instant camera that developed its own photos on the spot. While a freshman at Harvard University in 1926, Herbert had become interested in polarized light (light oriented in a plane with respect to the source). After taking a leave of absence from the university, he spent several years developing a new kind of photographic technology that later evolved into the Polaroid Camera.
In the American League...
On March 29th in St. Petersburg Florida, the New York Yankees and rival Boston Red Sox went head-to-head for seventeen grueling innings only to have the contest called at a 2-2 tie after four hours and two minutes of play. It was the longest Spring Training game in Major League history.
The Cleveland Indians were accused of pulling a publicity stunt after signing the Negro League's greatest pitcher Satchel Paige to a Major League contract. The forty-two year-old veteran answered all of his critics after going on to post a 6-1 record as the oldest player ever to debut in the majors.
Chicago outfielder Pat Seerey hit four home runs (the last in the eleventh inning) to lead the White Sox to a 12-11 victory over the home team Athletics in Philadelphia. In doing so, he became only the fifth player ever to accomplish the feat. Seerey had also set the record for reaching fifteen or more total bases in a single game (1945) and would later set the Major League mark as the first player to strike out seven times in a doubleheader.
In the National League...
Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals put on a hitting clinic at Crosley Field during an April 30th outing against the Cincinnati Reds. ""Stan The Man"" totaled five hits in the first of four such performances during the season. Only Ty Cobb and Willie Keeler had accomplished the same feat while going 5+ at the plate on four separate occasions.
Ralph Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates startled pitchers across the league after hitting a home run every single Sunday for eight successive weeks in May and June. By the end of the season, he tallied seventeen round trippers over thirty-eight Sunday outings.
At the end of the year, the Brooklyn Dodgers traded the extremely talented, but even more accident prone Pete Reiser to the Boston Braves for Mike McCormick. Reiser had become one of the top outfielders of his time, but had damaged his reputation after being carried off the field on a stretcher eleven times throughout the season after crashing into the outfield walls.
Around the League...
Major League Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler fined the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, and Philadelphia Phillies $500 each after it was discovered that they were attempting to sign high school players for the upcoming season.
Herb Pennock, the fifty-three-year-old general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies collapsed in a New York hotel lobby on January 30th and died a short time later at a local hospital. Ironically, one month later, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame after receiving ninety-four of the required ninety-one votes.
The New York Yankees retired Babe Ruth's No. 3 jersey on June 13th during a special pre-game ceremony that marked ""The Bambino's"" final appearance at Yankee Stadium, which was celebrating its 25th anniversary. A perennial pinstripe legend, Ruth's astounding abilities at the plate and larger-than-life personality off the field had made him a tremendous drawing card throughout the league as well as the highest-paid player of his era.
On August 16th, baseball lost its greatest player after Babe Ruth succumbed to throat cancer at the age of fifty-three. Fittingly, his last public appearance had come three weeks earlier at the premier of a movie about his amazing life titled ""The Babe Ruth Story"". As an unprecedented tribute, his body lay in state at Yankee Stadium, also known as ""The House That Ruth Built"", and was viewed by more than 100,000 fans that lined up for miles just to pay their respects.

Lou Boudreau not only managed the Cleveland Indians to the American League Pennant, he also helped the team offensively finishing second in hits, third in home runs, first in doubles, third in runs batted in, and first in runs scored.
Did you know that the first no-hitter thrown during the evening hours was accomplished on June 30, 1948? It was tossed by Bob Lemon at Briggs Stadium and the Cleveland Indians won 2-0 versus the Detroit Tigers under the lights.
The Sporting News called the contractual signing of Satchel Paige ""a travesty on baseball,"" but on July 9, 1948, the oldest rookie in Major League history made his first appearance (he relieved Bob Lemon in the fifth inning at Municipal Stadium) in a Major League game making him the first black pitcher in American League history.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1959 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United States expanded its borders as both Alaska and Hawaii were officially admitted to the Union. Despite an overwhelming vote by Alaskans in 1956, it took more than two years for the Senate to finally agree to make Alaska the forty-ninth state. On March 18, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower added Hawaii, the Aloha State, and commissioned a new fifty star U.S. Flag.
Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), and Ritchie Valens died when their Beechcraft plane crashed just outside Clear Lake, Iowa, during a stormy winter night. Holly was famous for many hits including ""Peggy Sue."" The Big Bopper had one big hit, ""Chantilly Lace."" And Valens was best known for his hit, ""La Bamba."" The tragic accident was penned in the papers as ""The Day the Music Died"".
Scandal rocked America's most popular Game Show ""Twenty-One"" after former champion Herbert Stempel confessed to being given the answers to questions, told which questions to miss, and coached in presentation. After he blew the whistle, public outrage was so great that in 1959 Congress opened hearings on the great American quiz show fix and later formally outlawed all future quiz show deceptions.
In the American League...
The Boston Red Sox remained as the only Major League team not to include minority players in its line-up. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a grievance against the franchise charging them with racial discrimination and calling for an official investigation into the team's signing policies.
Chicago White Sox second baseman Nellie Fox managed five hits in seven at bats on Opening Day (including a two-run home run off pitcher Don Mossi to win the game) during a fourteen-inning, 9-7 victory over the Detroit Tigers. His five hits in a season opener tied a Major League record that would not be matched for forty years.
Cleveland's Rocky Colavito hit four consecutive home runs at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium en route to an 11-8 victory over the home team Orioles. The Indian slugger joined Lou Gehrig and Bobby Lowe as the only Major League players ever to hit four consecutive round-trippers.
In the National League...
On May 26, Pirates ace Harvey Haddix pitched a perfect game against Milwaukee for twelve innings, only to lose in the 13th. After Felix Mantilla managed to reach base on a fielding error, Hank Aaron was intentionally walked. Pittsburgh's strategy proved meaningless though as Joe Adcock maintained the Braves newfound momentum with a three-run blast for the comeback win. The following day National League President Warren Giles ruled that the final score should be amended to 1-0, since both runners Henry Aaron and Joe Adcock were both ruled out. (Aaron had been called for leaving the field during play, and Adcock had passed him in the base path.)
Seven pitchers combined to tie a National League record with twenty-three strikeouts during a May 31 outing between the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. Sandy Koufax led the effort with nine ""K's"" for the 5-3 win.
The San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs set a new record for the longest nine-inning game in history after playing for three hours and fifty minutes. The home team finally won the ""marathon at Wrigley"" with a score of 20-9 after tallying nineteen hits and five home runs.
Around the League...
The Rules Committee finally permitted inter-league trading for a limited, three-and-a-half-week period during Major League Baseball's winter meetings.
The Players Association fired lawyer J. Norman Lewis and replaced him with Judge Robert C. Cannon, the son of Wisconsin Congressman Raymond J. Cannon, who had attempted to unionize the players during the 1920 season.
Controversy erupted over the American League batting title as the Cleveland Indians' Tito Francona finished the season with a league leading .363 average, but fell one at-bat short (three-hundred ninety-nine) of the required total (four-hundred). As a result, Harvey Kuenn of the Detroit Tigers was crowned the American League batting champion.
Washington D.C. Senator Estes Kefauver warned Major League Baseball that they were closely monitoring the ""attitudes of organized baseball"" toward the Continental League in an effort to prevent any antitrust issues.
""It takes all winter to train them (the insects which caused a 28 minute delay on June 2, 1959) and now, poof, on lousy bomb (fireworks) and they're all blown-up."" - White Sox owner Bill Veeck

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1960 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The fifty-star Flag of the United States was officially dedicated on July 4. The newly expanded banner had been modified following the admission of the 50th state, Hawaii, on August 21, 1959 with an Executive Order filed by President Eisenhower providing the arrangement of nine rows of stars staggered horizontally and eleven rows staggered vertically.
President Eisenhower signed the Civil Rights Act of 1960 enabling federal judges to appoint referees to hear persons claiming that state election officials had denied minorities the right to register and vote. Though well intended, the statute proved ineffective, making it necessary for President Lyndon B. Johnson to persuade Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965.
John F. Kennedy, a first-ballot nominee, defeated Richard Nixon to become the youngest President ever elected in the United States. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President and immediately set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II.
In the American League...
On Opening Day, ""Teddy Baseball"" (Ted Williams) tied the ""Iron Horse"" (Lou Gehrig) with the 493rd home run of his career. The 500' blast in his first at-bat remained the only bright moment for Boston as the Washington Senators' Camilo Pascual struck out 11 Red Sox batters on the way to a 10-1 victory. Williams hit number 500 later that season with a 3-1 win over the Cleveland Indians on June 17.
American League Most Valuable Player Roger Maris debuted as a New York Yankee against the Boston Red Sox with 2 home runs and 4 RBIs en route to an 8-4 win at Fenway Park.
Baltimore Orioles catcher Clint Courtney became the first at his position to complete 2 career unassisted double plays during a 5-3 loss to the New York Yankees.
In the National League...
George Crowe of the St. Louis Cardinals hit four-pinch homers for a Major League career record of fourteen.
Baseball's greatest defensive player became baseball's greatest offensive player with a single at-bat during the Pittsburgh Pirates versus New York Yankees World Series. After being statistically dominated by their American League rivals for six outings, the National League champions found themselves with their backs against the wall at Forbes Field for Game 7. Stats mattered little in the end though as second baseman Bill Mazeroski stepped up to the plate (in the bottom of the ninth) and delivered a desperate, bases-empty home run for the 10-9 victory and the first Pirates World Championship in thirty-five years.
The Los Angeles Dodgers set an all-time National League record for attendance with 2,253,887 coming out to the Coliseum.
Around the League...
Bill Veeck became the first to break uniform tradition after putting the names of his players on the backs of their Chicago White Sox jerseys. In reaction, the rest of the league's teams sent formal protests to the commissioner's office demanding that the names be removed. After hearing both sides, it was determined that each team would have the option to add their names or stay with the traditional number only.
Television icon Gene Autry attended the annual American League owners meeting while investigating possible broadcasting opportunities. After realizing Autry's true respect for the game of baseball as well as his political connections in California, American League President Joe Cronin nominated him for ownership. The result was the birth of the California Angels expansion franchise.
The Sporting News named Boston Red Sox icon Ted Williams as their ""Player of the Decade"" for the 1950s.
The last remaining chapter in the Negro Leagues disbanded after a steady decline in talent due to the inclusion and rapid growth of African-American players in the Major Leagues.
""They examined all my organs. Some of them are quite remarkable and others are not so good. A lot of museums are bidding for them."" - Casey Stengel

Ted Williams hit some interesting home runs in 1960 including: June 17, when he joined the 500 Home Runs Club; September 2, when he hit a home run off Don Lee - the son of pitcher Thornton Lee who Williams hit a home run off of twenty years earlier; and September 26, when Williams hit a home run in his final major league at-bat.
On April 19, 1960, Roger Maris made his debut in a New York Yankees uniform and responded in style with four hits, four runs batted in, and two home runs.
On September 10, 1960, Mickey Mantle hit a home run over the right-field roof at Tiger Stadium. Did you know that this was the third time during his career where he cleared the roof at Tiger Stadium and the first time the ball cleared Trumbull Avenue?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1961 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
A new American based humanitarian organization called the ""Peace Corps"" was started at the insistence President John F. Kennedy. The program encouraged young people, most just out of college, to volunteer a year of their time to work as teachers, health care providers or other advisors for poor nations in Africa, Asia and South America.
The United States government pledged to increase its military presence to aid South Vietnam in the fight against the Viet Cong rebels. Although not ""officially engaged"" in a formal state of war, the new agreement provided increased funding for the Vietnamese army and more U.S. advisors in the field.
An unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government of Cuban premier Fidel Castro by United States-backed rebels took place in April. An invasion force consisting of approximately 1,500 Cuban exiles, armed with U.S. weapons, landed at the Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) on the south coast hoping to find support from the local population. Within hours, most were wiped out by Castro's own troops or taken prisoner for ransom. Acting President John F. Kennedy took full responsibility for the disaster, even though the plans had been put in place during the Eisenhower administration.
In the American League...
New York's newly crowned single-season home run champion Roger Maris beat out Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle by 4 votes for the American League Most Valuable Player Award.
On September 15, the New York Yankees also broke the all-time home run record (for a team) with 223 round-trippers. The combined franchise mark had been previously held by the 1947 New York Giants and the 1956 Cincinnati Reds.
Baltimore Orioles slugger Jim Gentile tied Ernie Banks' Major League record for most grand slams in a season after hitting his 5th off of the Chicago White Sox' Don Larsen.
In the National League...
On September 15, Los Angeles Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax set down 10 Milwaukee Braves bringing his season total to 243 — a National League record for left-handed pitchers. The New York Giants' Rube Marquard had held the National League lefty record previously after fanning 237 in 1911.
The San Francisco Giants set a new precedent for Major League salaries after signing Willie Mays to an $85,000 contract — the highest in their history and the most paid to any player in 1961.
The National League's newest franchise was officially christened as the ""Mets"" after New York fans were asked to vote on a list of finalists submitted by mail. Other names selected for the ballot included the ""Burros"", ""Skyliners"", ""Rebels"" and ""Skyscrapers"".
Around the League...
Political tensions between the United States and Cuba initially prevented all Cuban players, including Minnie Minoso of the Chicago White Sox and Camilo Pascual and Pedro Ramos of the Minnesota Twins, from returning to the U.S. for the 1961 season. After several negotiations, a high-ranking foreign ministry official finally permitted their unconditional return.
""The M&M Boys"" (Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris) became THE single most important story in the 1961 season as both New York Yankee teammates raced to beat Babe Ruth's single-season homerun record of sixty. After going head-to-head for several months, Mantle fell out of the race due to a serious hip infection that required hospitalization. Maris pressed on and finally topped ""The Bambino"" during the final game of the season with number 61 off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red Sox. Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ruled that Maris' record would be recorded with an asterisk in the books, making it a separate and distinctive record due to the new one-hundred sixty-two game schedule. Years later, acting Commissioner Fay Vincent reversed the ruling, ""removing the asterisk"" and recognizing Maris as an official record-breaker.
In response to the rash of home runs around the league, both American League President Joe Cronin and National League President Warren Giles agreed to order tests to determine if the ""1961 baseball"" was ""livelier"" than those of past seasons. The investigation conducted by technologists at Foster D. Snell Inc. concluded that the ball was slightly larger and several ounces lighter than the one used by Babe Ruth in the 1920s.
""I really believe that the sixty-one homers was the greatest feat in baseball history."" - Mickey Mantle

Did you know that sixty-first home run ball hit by Roger Maris on October 1st in Yankee Stadium landed in Box 163D, Section 33? The historic ball was retrieved by Sal Durante who won a trip to Sacramento, a trip to Seattle World's Fair, and received $5,000 for the ball.
Norm Cash of the Detroit Tigers led the American League with nineteen intentional bases on balls. Johnny Blanchard, Mickey Mantle, and Bill Skowron led the New York Yankees with nine each. Roger Maris, who batted after Mantle, led the league in runs scored, runs batted in, home runs, and total bases yet he did not receive a single intentional pass during 1961.
On July 17, 1961, former Tiger superstar Ty Cobb died in Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. Mickey Cochrane, Nap Rucker, and Ray Schalk were the only former Major League players to attend his funeral.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1962 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After hearing the case of Engel vs. Vitale, the Supreme Court ruled that state-sponsored prayer in schools was unconstitutional. Although prayer was not outlawed in school entirely (only school-sponsored prayer) the decision ignited a controversy that has continued unabated until today.
In February, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in orbit and John Glenn followed later that year as the first to travel into space after a fifteen minute flight on July 21st. Both missions were in preparation of meeting President Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.
In late August, American spy planes detected the building of military missile sites in Cuba. U.S. Intelligence sources later determined the Soviets, under Nikita Khrushchev, had decided to shorten the strategic gap between the two world powers by placing missiles there limiting America's warning capabilities if attacked. In October, President John F. Kennedy was presented with conclusive proof that the Soviets were in fact installing medium-range ballistic missiles. After several tense days of defensive posturing, the issue was peacefully resolved after the United States agreed not to invade Cuba, and the Soviets agreed to withdraw all military forces and weapons.
In the American League...
The Baltimore Orioles' Brooks Robinson became only the fifth player in Major League history to hit grand slams in back-to-back games after knocking out a bases loaded round-tripper on May 6th and May 9th.
After missing thirty games due to recurring knee injuries, New York's Mickey Mantle limped to the plate as a pinch hitter and launched a four-hundred twenty foot blast off of Gary Bell of the Cleveland Indians. The home team crowd showed their respects by giving the visiting Yankee a standing ovation.
Earl Wilson became the first black pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the American League as the Boston Red Sox topped the California Angels 2-0 on June 26th at Fenway Park. Wilson also dominated at the plate with a four-hundred foot homer off Bo Belinsky who had tossed a ""no-no"" of his own in his last start against the Baltimore Orioles.
In the National League...
On September 7th, Los Angeles Dodger Maury Wills stole four bases off the Pittsburgh Pirates setting a National League record for eighty-two ""robberies"" in a single season.
The Houston Colt 45s, one of the National Leagues two new teams (New York Mets), opened with an impressive 11-2 triumph over the Chicago Cubs before a crowd of over 25,000. Roman Mejias set the pace with two, three-run home runs and Hal Smith followed close behind debuting with a round-tripper of his own.
Stan Musial set a National League record (previously held by Mel Ott) after scoring for the 1,806th time in his career during a St. Louis Cardinals win over the Chicago Cubs on April 13th. Later in the season Musial became the leagues all-time leader in total bases with 5,864 during a June 22nd outing against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Around the League...
John ""Buck"" O'Neil became the first African-American coach in Major League baseball after joining the staff of the Chicago Cubs. O'Neil had been a scout for the Cubs organization previously and was credited with discovering both Ernie Banks and Lou Brock.
Baseball's newest franchise, the New York Mets, debuted in what some referred to as ""copycat uniforms"" that featured Dodger blue sleeves, Giants orange lettering and Yankee pinstripes. Unfortunately the Mets played as bad as they looked and finished their inaugural season with a laughable 40-120 record.
After several years of ""double-headers"", both players and owners agreed to return the All-Star Game to its original, one-game format in 1963.
Kansas City owner Charles Finley hired the first woman in baseball broadcasting. Betty Caywood was brought in initially to do ""color-commentary"" for the A's games, but later became the first female to regularly announce baseball games while airing her reports from both the dugout and the stands.
""As his teammates rushed out of the dugout, and the home crowd went wild (no-hitter being tossed), (Bo) Belinsky pointed to the stands and said to his catcher Buck Rodgers, 'Hey look at that blonde.' "" - Steve Wulf in Baseball Anecdotes (1981)

On April 9, 1962, President John F. Kennedy threw out the Opening Day pitch in the newly opened $20 million District of Columbia Stadium. The Washington Senators won versus the Detroit Tigers 4-1, but finished the season with more than 100 losses.
On May 5, 1962, Bo Belinsky pitched the Angels first ever no-hit game and the first in the American League since 1958! After the game reporters asked him what it was like and Belinsky replied, ""If I'd known I was gonna pitch a no-hitter today, I would have gotten a haircut.""
On September 12, 1962, Tom Cheney of the Washington Senators struck out a Major League record 21 batters during an extra inning game. The Baltimore Orioles lost 2-1 in 16 innings and every batter, except for Boog Powell, was struck out at least once. Did you know that Cheney did not allow a single hit from the 8th inning forward and that the Senators won thanks to a walk-off home run hit by Bud Zipfel?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1963 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Minister and civil-rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King led over two hundred thousand people in the largest non-violent demonstration ever held to support the passage of civil rights legislation. The historic march on Washington D.C. was highlighted by King's infamous ""I have a dream"" speech in which he stated ""one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: we hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal.""
On November 22nd, President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed as he rode through the streets of Dallas, Texas aboard the presidential motorcade. Lee Harvey Oswald was later identified as the lone assassin although his guilt was never proven in a court of law. While in police custody, Oswald himself was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.
As a first step toward ending the ""Cold War"", a test ban agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union was ratified by the Senate on October 10. The contract between the world's two superpowers prohibited any future above ground testing of nuclear weapons of mass destruction.
In the American League...
Detroit Tiger Billy Bruton tied a Major League record for most doubles in a single game after hitting four straight to top the Washington Senators 5-1 on May 19th. Teammate and rookie pitcher Bill Faul matched Bruton's efforts on the mound while tossing a three hitter in his first Major League start.
On May 22nd, Mickey Mantle hit what is considered by many experts to be the longest homerun in Major League history. Batting left-handed against the visiting Kansas City A's at Yankee Stadium, Mantle opened the eleventh inning with a monumental blast off Bill Fisher that traveled three-hundred seventy-four feet from home plate, bouncing off of the third tier facade and falling just inches short of going out of the stadium. A senior physicist from the University of Arizona, Professor J.E. McDonald, calculated the estimated distance the ball would have traveled at six-hundred twenty feet.
Cleveland pitcher Early Wynn finally won his 300th (and final) game thanks to a little help from the Indian's bullpen. After losing eight straight and struggling through five innings during the second half of a Kansas City doubleheader, Wynn was replaced by relief man Jerry Walker who tossed four scoreless sides en route to a 7-4 win over the Athletics.
In the National League...
Chicago Cubs first baseman Ernie Banks became the first National League player to tally twenty-two putouts (and twenty-three chances) in a game, during a May 9th, 3-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
On June 15th, Juan Marichal set two records after becoming the first Latin American pitcher AND only the second Giant (Carl Hubbell, 1929) to pitch a no-hitter during a 1-0 triumph over the Houston Colt 45s (Astros) at Candlestick Park.
Milwaukee Brave veteran Warren Spahn topped the National League record for most starts (previously held by Grover Alexander) with his 601st appearance on the mound during a 6-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 23rd. Later in the season Spahn tied Christy Mathewson's National League record with his thirteenth, twenty-win season and became the oldest to do so at age forty-two.
Around the League...
The Major League Rules Committee voted to expand the strike zone, extending it from the top of the shoulders to the bottom of the knees restoring its original pre-1950 specifications.
On September 6th, Major League Baseball celebrated its 100,000th game with a classic match-up between the Cleveland Indians and Washington Senators at D.C. Stadium.
St. Louis Cardinals' slugger Stan Musial made a record 24th All-Star Game appearance as his National League teammates combined to beat their American League counterparts 5-3 in the Midsummer Classic.
Houston Colt 45s (Astros) manager Harry Craft shocked the New York Mets after starting an all-rookie line-up during a September 27th contest. Fifteen rookies appeared in all, but were bested by the older and wiser Mets who ""mentored"" them with a 10-3 lesson in experience.
""I can see how he (Sandy Koufax) won 25 games, but what I can't understand is how he lost five."" - Yogi Berra in 1963 World Series

On June 19, 1963, Gates Brown hit a home run in his first Major League at-bat making him the first American League black player to join this unique set of long ball hitters.
After eight long failed starts, Early Wynn finally joined the elite 300 Wins Club on July 13, 1963. The forty-three year-old righthander (who began his Major League career in 1939) went five innings, struck out three batters, walked three, and gave up six hits in a 7-4 victory over the Kansas City Athletics.
Have you ever wondered about errorless streaks by a team? On August 7, 1963, the Detroit Tigers played their 12th consecutive game without an error — a new Major League record for that time.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1964 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On February 9th, the British rock group The Beatles arrived in America for an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was the ""Fab 4's"" first trip to the United States and introduced their unique sound and stylish appearance to millions of American teenagers. By the week of April 4th, The Beatles had taken over the radio airways and held the top five slots on the American pop charts.
The highly contested and still criticized Warren Commission delivered its final report on September 27th concluding that President John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, had acted alone and on his own recourse.
American's first computer dynasty International Business Machines (also known as IBM) introduced the first 360 Computer, which was defined as a second-generation system based on transistors. The groundbreaking machine was instantly heralded as a huge success and became the standard for computers of many businesses for many years.
In the American League...
Mickey Mantle set the tenth Major League record of his career after hitting two ""switch"" home runs in a single game against the Chicago White Sox. Mantle's first shot off Ray Herbert (a left-handed effort) traveled 461 feet and finally stopped 502 feet from the plate. Later in the game, ""The Mick"" added a second round-tripper (swinging right-handed) that guaranteed rookie pitcher Mel Stottlemyre's 7-3 debut victory.
Decades before the ""Roberto Alomar incident"" Golden Glove first baseman Vic Power of the California Angels was suspended for ten days and fined $250 after spitting on umpire Jim Honochick during a doubleheader loss to the Chicago White Sox.
Kansas City A's rookie Bert Campaneris became only the second player (Bob Nieman) since 1900 to hit two home runs in his Major League debut during a 4-3 win over Jim Kaat and the Minnesota Twins. He also set the mark as the first American League player ever to knock one out on the first pitch thrown to him. Bill Roman of the Detroit Tigers equaled the feat later in the season during a 7-6, loss to the New York Yankees for his first (and last) career home run.
In the National League...
Willie Mays became the first African-American player to hold the ""team leader title"" after San Francisco Giants' skipper Alvin Dark named him as the team's captain.
On April 6th, ""Shea Stadium"" was officially dedicated as the New York Mets ballpark. The $25 million dollar facility was named after William A. Shea who christened baseball's newest cathedral by pouring a mixture of water from the Harlem River (near the old Polo Grounds) and the Gowanus Canal (near the site of Ebbets Field) over the infield in a pre-game ceremony.
The St. Louis Cardinals became only the second team in the modern era (1923 Giants) to score at least one run in every inning while rolling over the Chicago Cubs during a September 13th outing at Wrigley Field. ""Redbirds"" Lou Brock and Julian Javier led the rally with one homer each and Curt Simmons topped Dick Ellsworth on the mound for the 15-2 win.
Around the League...
Subscription television for baseball games debuted on July 17th as the first pay cablecast (a night game between the LA Dodgers and Chicago Cubs) was broadcasted live from Los Angeles. The home team emerged as 3-2 winners thanks to the solid arm of Don Drysdale who sat down ten batters.
The National League avoided an umpires' strike by agreeing with the officials on a new five-year contract that increased both pensions and insurance payments.
After an eleven year stint in Milwaukee, the Braves Board of Directors unanimously voted to request permission from the National League to move the struggling franchise to Atlanta. Milwaukee County officials immediately sued to block the move despite the team's faltering attendance of 800,000 for the past two seasons. In November, the league ordered the Braves to stay put in Milwaukee for the upcoming season, but permitted a move to Atlanta in 1966.
Major League Baseball finally approved a free-agent draft system that mimicked the one used in professional football. Order of selection was determined in reverse order of each club's previous season standings and all draftees were to be included on the forty man roster. They also restored all powers rescinded after Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis's death in 1944 to the baseball commissioner's office. The decision waived all owners' rights to take legal action in the event of disagreements and granted the commissioner total authority to judge whether actions taken by a team and/or owner were in the best interests of the game.
""It was pretty somber. Yogi said, 'Hey (Phil) Linz, shove that (harmonica) right up you #*@.' I didn't hear him so I asked Mickey (Mantle) what Yogi had said and Mick said, 'He said play it louder.' So I did. Yogi went berserk and came charging to the back of the bus, enraged. Mick couldn't stop laughing."" - Phil Linz in the New York Daily News (August 21, 1964)

On May 2, 1964, Tony Oliva, Bob Allison, Jimmie Hall, and Harmon Killebrew (in that order) each hit a home run during the eleventh inning making the Twins only the third team to accomplish the feat to date.
On August 12, 1964, Mickey Mantle hit switch hit home runs during the same game for the tenth time in his career - a new Major League record. The first blast cleared the 461-foot marker, carried over the 22 foot screen, and landed approximately 14 rows into the bleachers. A reporter told Mantle after the game that the ball traveled 502 feet and Mantle replied, ""Aw, I didn't hit it all that good.""
On September 30, 1954, Luis Tiant and Sam McDowell struck out seventeen Boston Red Sox batters during a doubleheader at Fenway Park. The Indians won both ends and set a new American League record for team strikeouts during a single season.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1965 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Controversial civil rights activist Malcolm Little, also known as ""Malcolm X"", was assassinated while delivering a speech at the OAAU rally in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem on February 21st. The Islamic minister had become an inspirational leader alongside Dr. Martin Luther King after breaking ties with the Nation of Islam in order to create his own religious community known as Muslim Mosque, Inc., and later the Organization of Afro-American Unity.
A routine traffic stop and arrest for drunk driving in South Central Los Angeles lit the fire for what would become known as the Watts Riots. In response to the police action, many residents accused the law of practicing racial bias and erupted violently for six days leaving thirty-four dead, over a thousand people injured, nearly four-thousand arrested, and hundreds of buildings destroyed.
Construction on the nation's tallest memorial, the Gateway Arch, was finally completed after a four-year span. The six-hundred thirty feet high, stainless steel structure was originally designed by architect Eero Saarinen in 1947 for the Expansion Memorial Park which was established on the banks of the Mississippi River to commemorate the westward growth of the United States.
In the American League...
New York Yankees ace Mel Stottlemyre became the first pitcher in fifty-five years to hit an inside-the-park home run during a 6-3 win over their American League rivals, the Boston Red Sox, on July 20th.
Bert Campaneris, of the Kansas City Athletics, set an unprecedented Major League record by playing all nine positions during a September 8th outing against the California Angels. Campaneris allowed just one run (on a hit) and two walks while on the mound, but went 0-for-3 at the plate. Despite the ""one man show"" the Angels went on to win it, 5-3 after thirteen innings.
Shortstop Ron Hanson of the Chicago White Sox tied a Major League record with twenty-eight fielding chances during a double-header against the Boston Red Sox. Hanson handled eighteen shots in the first contest, setting an American League record, and ten more in the nightcap. Chicago, like their shortstop, came out on top in both games with matching 3-2 victories.
In the National League...
On April 9th, the $31 million dollar, ultramodern indoor ballpark known as the ""Astrodome"" debuted with an exhibition game between the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Texas Governor John Connally were among the 47,000+ plus fans who witnessed the first ever, indoor home run courtesy of Mickey Mantle.
Chicago ""Cubbie"" Ernie Banks slugged his four-hundredth career homer during a 5-3 triumph over Curt Simmons and the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field.
San Francisco slugger Willie Mays became the fifth member of the ultra-exclusive ""500 Home Runs Club"" after paying the membership dues off Don Nottebart during a 5-1 Giants victory over the Houston Astros at the Astrodome.
Around the League...
Baseball's first free-agent draft was held at the Hotel Commodore in New York City resulting in three-hundred twenty players being selected by twenty Major League teams. It was later determined that the draft would continue to take place every June and January with teams selecting prospects in the reverse order of the league standings.
One of baseball's greatest left-handed aces, Warren Spahn announced his retirement after an amazing twenty-one seasons. Spahn walked away from the game with a 363-245 career record and a lifetime ERA of 3.09. He also ranked as number six on the all-time list with sixty-three shutouts and thirteen, twenty-win seasons.
On December 9th, Branch Rickey, the man who helped Jackie Robinson break through baseball's color barrier by signing him with the Brooklyn Dodgers, died at the age of eighty-three.
Los Angeles Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax became the first two-time recipient of the Cy Young Award. Unfortunately, he would manage only one more season (where he became the first three-time recipient) before retiring with an astounding 165-87 record over a twelve year period.
""I again find myself humbled and somewhat overwhelmed by the events unfolding in front of us."" - Al Kaline

On June 20, 1965, Tigers superstar Al Kaline hit a single and drove in two runs versus the Athletics. Kaline helped his team overcome an eight run deficit, but he will remember this day more as the game in which he had career RBI number one-thousand.
On September 8, 1965, Bert Campaneris of the Athletics became the first player in Major League history to play all nine positions during a game.
On September 16, 1965, Dave Morehead of the Boston Red Sox tossed a 2-0 no-hitter versus the Cleveland Indians. Morehead came within one walk (Rocky Colavito) of a perfect game! But, did you know that following the game team owners fired General Manager Pinky Higgins and replaced him with Dick O'Connell?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1966 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After murdering both his wife and mother, serial sniper Charles Whitman ascended to the observation deck at Austin's University of Texas tower killing fourteen people and injuring thirty-one others during a ninety-minute shooting spree. He was eventually shot and killed himself after a civilian and two police officers stormed the tower and overpowered him.
Media icon Walt Disney, who turned the whimsical cartoon world of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck into a million dollar a year entertainment empire, died of cancer at the age of sixty-five. The pioneering animator had produced the first fully animated motion picture and had invented the original concept of theme parks with his final masterpiece, Disneyland in California.
The first U.S. manned space flights, Gemini 8 thru 12, were launched in preparation for man's eventual trip to the moon. Following the pioneering Mercury program and preceding the Apollo missions, Gemini flights were specifically developed to learn how to maneuver a spacecraft into orbit and rendezvous with other docking vehicles.
In the American League...
On July 29th, Mickey Mantle hit his four-hundred ninety-fourth homerun off of Chicago White Sox ace Bruce Howard moving himself ahead of fellow Yankee Lou Gehrig for sixth place on the all-time list. Teammate Al Downing sweetened the deal with a clutch 2-1 performance on the mound.
Baltimore Orioles slugger ""Boog"" Powell astonished the crowd at Fenway Park after hitting not one, not two, but three, opposite-field homers OVER the ""Green Monster"" on the way to a 4-3, victory in which he totaled thirteen bases himself. Powell would also go on to become the first player ever to appear in the Little League World Series as well as the Major League version.
Teammate Frank Robinson was unanimously voted as the American League MVP becoming the first player to win the title in both the American and National Leagues since the Baseball Writers Association took it over in 1931. Robinson, who also won the American League Triple Crown, was also voted most valuable player in 1961 as a member of the Cincinnati Reds.
In the National League...
Tony Cloninger, of the recently transplanted Atlanta Braves, became the first National League pitcher to ever hit two grand-slams in a single game during a July 3rd, 17-3 triumph over the San Francisco Giants. Cloninger's first slam came off of rival pitcher Bob Priddy in the first, and then in the fourth he added another off of Ray Sadecki.
Willie Mays moved up to #2 (behind Babe Ruth) on the all-time list with his five-hundred thirty-fifth career home run, off of Ray Washburn, as the San Francisco Giants topped the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3 on August 17th.
On October 2nd, Sandy Koufax tallied his last Major League victory with a 6-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies for the National League pennant. The Los Angeles Dodgers ace completed his twelve-year career with an amazing 165-87 record with a 2.76 ERA, forty shutouts and two-thousand three-hundred ninety-six strikeouts. Koufax also held the National League single-season strikeout record with three-hundred eighty-two K's (1965) and compiled an astounding 0.95 ERA in seven World Series starts.
Around the League...
Major League Baseball's first African-American umpire, Emmett Ashford made his debut on Opening Day as the American League's Washington Senators lost to the visiting Cleveland Indians 5-2.
Ted Williams used a portion of his Hall of Fame induction speech to plead for the inclusion of Negro League players including Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
The infield at Houston's Astrodome became the first to be replaced by the new experimental surface known as ""Astroturf"". In the first game ever to be played on the artificial grass, the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers prevailed over the home team 6-3.
Dan Topping sold his remaining shares of interest in the New York Yankees to the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) for a reported $1.4 million dollars. In the end, the television dynasty paid a total of $14 million for total control of the franchise. Topping initially looked to come out on top in the deal as three days later, only four-hundred thirteen fans showed up at Yankee Stadium for a game against the Chicago White Sox.
""Probably the most dramatic change in pitching I've observed in my years in baseball has been the disappearance of the knockdown or brushback pitch. This is why record numbers of home runs are flying out of ballparks, why earned run averages are soaring, and why there are so few twenty game winners in the majors."" - Frank Robinson

1966 AL Team Pitching Stats
On April 11, 1966, Emmett Ashford made history as the first black umpire in Major League Baseball, officiating an American League game where the Cleveland Indians triumphed over the Washington Senators 5-2 at D.C. Stadium.
Frank Robinson can give part credit during this Triple Crown season to Andy Etchebarren. Why? Because Andy saved Robinson from drowning at a pool party on August 22, 1966.
Records for most pitches during a game are not kept or are they considered official; however, Denny McLain might be in the top ten. On August 29, 1966, McLain threw 229 pitches in a nine walk, eight hit, 6-3 victory versus the Orioles.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1967 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The entire crew of the Apollo One spacecraft including Virgil Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee were killed during a pre-launch rehearsal after fire swept through their Saturn rocket as it sat on its launching pad. The tragedy marked the first deaths of any astronaut while actively engaged in the American space program.
The United States Senate promoted Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall as the first African-American member of the Supreme Court. Previous to his nomination from President Lyndon B. Johnson, Marshall had held office in the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals after President John F. Kennedy recognized him as one of the country's most promising attorneys.
American labor leader Jimmy Hoffa was arrested and sentenced to thirteen years in prison following a series of government investigations into illegal business practices. While serving his sentence at a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, he refused to resign as president of the Teamsters and retained the support of most union members. United States President Richard Nixon eventually commuted Hoffa's sentence releasing him from prison on Christmas Eve, 1971. Four years later, while attempting to rebuild his administration, Hoffa ""disappeared"" after apparently attending a meeting at the Red Fox restaurant in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. To this day, the Teamster leader has never been found and was declared legally dead in 1982.
In the American League...
On May 30th, New York Yankees lefty Whitey Ford surprisingly announced his retirement after struggling for several weeks due to a bone spur on his throwing elbow. The perennial ace finished his career with an amazing 236-109 record, a 2.75 lifetime ERA, ten World Series wins and the highest career winning percentage (.690) of any modern pitcher.
The Washington Senators managed to fight off exhaustion long enough to beat the Chicago White Sox 6-5 during a twenty-two inning contest that lasted six hours and thirty-eight minutes. The June 12th marathon set the record for the longest night game in American League history.
New York Yankees team president Mike Burke announced that ""The House That Ruth Built"" (also known as Yankee Stadium) would undergo its first major renovation at an estimated cost of $1.5 million dollars. The Mets agreed to allow the Bronx Bombers to use Shea Stadium while their park was getting the facelift.
In the National League...
St. Louis Cardinal and single-season home run champion Roger Maris hit a ""one in a million"" shot against the Pittsburgh Pirates for his first National League round-tripper. Unbelievably, Maris, who wore number 9, hit a ball into Seat 9, located in Row 9 during a game on May 9th.
The Chicago Cubs and New York Mets combined for eleven home runs (Cubs eight, Mets three) during the second game of a June 11th doubleheader. The unexpected ""home run derby"" tied a Major League record originally set by the Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees in 1950.
Tony Perez ended the longest All-Star Game in Major League history (fifteen innings) to date after launching a home run off ""Catfish"" Hunter for the 2-1 National League victory. Despite the game-winning hit, pitching reigned supreme at this Midsummer Classic as Ferguson Jenkins of the National League struck out seven, the American League allowed no walks and both leagues combined for thirty total strikeouts.
Around the League...
After an eleven-hour debate, the American League owners approved the move of Charles Finley's Athletics from Kansas City to Oakland. The junior circuit also mandated the expansion of the league with a deadline of 1971, guaranteeing a new franchise in both Kansas City and Seattle by that time.
The National League owners also agreed to a two team expansion and explored the possibilities of putting the new teams in Milwaukee, Dallas, Montreal, Toronto, Buffalo and / or San Diego.
St. Louis Cardinal Orlando Cepeda became the first National League MVP to be voted for unanimously while the American League MVP, Boston Red Sox slugger Carl Yastrzemski, won the Triple-Crown and led the American League in batting average (.326), slugging average (.622), home runs (tied with Harmon Killebrew with forty-four), RBIs (one-hundred twenty-one) and hits (one-hundred eighty-nine).
Four Baseball Hall of Fame inductees debuted during the 1967 season including Tom Seaver, Johnny Bench, Rod Carew and Reggie Jackson.
""And if I have my choice between a pennant and a triple crown, I'll take the pennant every time."" - Carl Yastrzemski (who did both this season)

On April 14, 1967, Red Sox rookie pitcher Billy Rohr made his Major League debut and pitched a no-hitter versus the Yankees through eight and two-thirds innings. Elston Howard broke up the gem and the Red Sox won 3-0. However, did you know that Rohr went on to win only 1 more game during 1967, 1 game in 1968, then left the big leagues at 22 years old?
MLB Baseball's Seasons | 1967 | MLB Advanced Media, LP.
On May 14, 1967, Mickey Mantle hit a 3-2 pitch served up by Stu Miller into the lower right-field stands. The blast was Mantle's five-hundredth making him the sixth big leaguer to reach that magic plateau.
On August 6, 1967, Dean Chance of Minnesota pitched 5 perfect innings of baseball. Rain halted the game and his shot a perfect game ended. 19 days later, on August 25, 1967, Chance missed perfection again, but still tossed a 2-1 no hitter versus the Cleveland Indians.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1968 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On April 4th, a lone assassin later identified as James Earl Ray, shot and killed America's leading civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King as he stood on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. A Baptist preacher, King had been on the forefront of the non-violent struggle to obtain civil rights for black Americans everywhere.
Robert Kennedy, brother of the late President John F. Kennedy, was also shot and killed on June 5th, after winning the Democratic primary for the Presidency in California. A lone gunman named Sirhan Sirhan attacked the former Attorney General as he exited through the kitchen at the Ambassador Hotel following a speech.
The U.S.S. Pueblo, an American intelligence-gathering vessel, was captured by the North Korean military who immediately accused the United States of conducting spy operations within their territorial waters. After eleven months of being taken prisoner and torture, the ships' crew was finally released. The U.S.S. Pueblo, still to this date, is the only ship of the U.S. Navy currently being held captive.
In the American League...
Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers became the first Major League pitcher to win thirty games since Dizzy Dean in 1934 as well as the first American League ace since Lefty Grove in 1931.
Five days later, McLain was on his way to win number thirty-one when the New York Yankees' Mickey Mantle tagged him for his five-hundred thirty-fifth career home run pushing him ahead of Jimmie Foxx for the #3 spot on the all-time list. Despite ""The Mick's"" mark, the Tigers managed to preserve the pitchers record with a clutch 6-2 performance.
On September 22, Cesar Tovar of the Minnesota Twins accomplished a rare and remarkable feat, becoming just the second player in MLB history to play all nine positions in a single game—matching the legendary performance of Bert Campaneris in 1965. In a twist of fate, the first batter Tovar faced as a pitcher was none other than Campaneris himself, who fouled out in his opening at-bat. Despite the historic spectacle, the Twins fell to the visiting Oakland Athletics in a tight 2-1 contest.
In the National League...
Los Angeles Dodgers' ace Don Drysdale passed Walter Johnson's 1913 record of 55 2/3 scoreless innings after going from May 14th to June 8th while tossing 58 2/3 of his own. Drysdale finally allowed a runner to reach home after Howie Bedell, of the Philadelphia Phillies scored Tony Taylor on a sacrifice fly.
On June 14th, Hank Aaron joined the ""500 Home Run Club"" with a three-run, four-hundred foot shot over the left-center field fence courtesy of the San Francisco Giants' Mike McCormick. ""Hammerin"" Hank became only the eighth player in Major League history to accomplish the feat which was sweetened by a 4-2 Atlanta Braves victory.
Bob Gibson, of the St. Louis Cardinals, tallied his twenty-second win and thirteenth shutout of the season on September 27th marking the first time a National tallied thirteen scoreless games since 1916. Gibson also boasted an ERA of 1.12, the second lowest ever in the National League.
Around the League...
The Players Relations Committee and Players Consistency Association signed the first Major League Baseball ""basic agreement"" which increased the league's minimum salary to $10,000 and identified a formal grievance procedure. Both sides also agreed to explore the options for a reserve clause.
The Major League Players Association signed a major card contract worth millions with the Topps baseball card company.
The Baseball Rules Committee made several major changes to the game resulting in the most modifications to be implemented at one time in the history of the game. They included: the pitcher's mound being lowered from fifteen inches to ten, the strike zone being decreased from the shoulders-to-knees to armpits-to-knees, tighter enforcement and penalties for illegal pitches, extra-inning ties resuming from the point of interruption instead of being replayed and finally the study of artificial surfaces on ball fields and the pros and cons of turf.
Both the American and National Leagues restructured their divisions resulting in the AL East consisting of Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Detroit, New York and Washington, the AL West including California, Chicago, Kansas City, Minnesota, Oakland and Seattle, the NL East featuring Chicago, Montreal, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and St. Louis and the NL West claiming Atlanta, Cincinnati, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.
""Anyone who could drink 25 Pepsis a day, play the organ in his (Denny McLain) spare time and win 31 games in a season was quite clearly, a very special person who deserved special privileges."" - Joe Falls in Detroit News

On May 8, 1968, Catfish Hunter pitched a perfect game against the Twins in the newly opened Oakland-Alameda Coliseum: the first no-hit, no-walk, no-error game in the American League since 1922.
On June 29, 1968, shortstop Ron Hansen turned the fifth unassisted triple play in American League history when he caught a hard hit liner (first out), tagged second (second out), then applied a tag to the runner coming from first (final out).
On September 14, 1968, Denny McLain became the first thirty game winner since Dizzy Dean of the St. Louis Cardinals. The most recent American League pitcher prior to McLain to win thirty games was Lefty Grove of the Philadelphia Athletics in 1931.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1969 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Apollo 11 astronaut, Neil Armstrong, became the first man to walk on the moon after landing the lunar module, known as the ""Eagle"" at Tranquility Base on July 16th. Armstrong made his historic descent to the surface live on television making the now historic statement: ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" Twenty-one hours and thirty-six minutes later (after conducting several experiments and planting the U.S. flag) the Eagle returned safe and sound to the Columbia for its return flight to Earth on July 24th.
On the night of August 9th, several members of a hippie cult led by self-proclaimed messiah Charles Manson brutally murdered actress Sharon Tate and four others in her Beverly Hills mansion. The next evening Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, wealthy owners of a grocery chain, were also brutally attacked in their Los Angeles home. Initially the crimes were not connected even though victims in both cases had suffered from multiple stab wounds and the words ""pig"" and ""Helter Skelter"" were written in blood all over both crime scenes.
The Woodstock Music and Art Festival was held at Max Yasgur's dairy farm in Bethel, New York representing the culmination of the counterculture of the 1960s and the high point of the ""hippie era."" Although 10,000 to 20,000 people were expected, well over 400,000 showed up and crashed the gate as music's biggest names including Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Joe Crocker, The Who and the Grateful Dead came together for three days of ""music, peace and love"".
In the American League...
On March 1st, ""The Commerce Comet"" also known as Mickey Mantle announced his retirement after eighteen years in professional baseball. During his Hall of Fame tenure with the New York Yankees, ""The Mick"" batted .298, hit five-hundred thirty-six home runs and appeared in an amazing sixty-five World Series games in which he tallied a record eighteen home runs and forty RBIs.
As Major League Baseball celebrated its Centennial season, two New York Yankees topped the commemorative list of the games greatest. ""Babe"" Ruth was unanimously crowned as the ""Greatest Player Ever"" and Joe DiMaggio was christened as the ""Greatest Living Player"".
Reggie Jackson hit two home runs and drove in a whopping ten runs as the Oakland Athletics regained first place in the American League West with a 21-7 romp over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on June 14th. Jackson doubled home a run in the first, homered in the third and fifth, singled in two in the seventh and drove in three more with a single in the eighth. The whopping twenty-one run total set a team record that wouldn't be matched until the 2000 season.
In the National League...
In the first regular season Major League Baseball game ever to be played outside of the borders of the United States, the Montreal Expos defeated the visiting St. Louis Cardinals 8-7. Both teams were introduced to the capacity crowd of 29,184 in both English and French Canadian.
St. Louis Cardinals ace Bob Gibson set a National League record on August 16th (reaching two-hundred strikeouts for the seventh season) after an 8-1 win over the Atlanta Braves.
On May 13th, Ernie Banks, of the Chicago Cubs, hit seven RBIs (including his one-thousand five-hundredth) with two, three-run home runs and a double during a 19-0 massacre over the San Diego Padres. The blowout tied the mark for the largest shutout margin in the history of the modern National League.
Around the League...
Ted Williams was named Jim Lemon's replacement as manager of the Washington Senators after the Capital's franchise finished in last place with a miserable 65-96 record. ""Teddy Baseball"" was reported to have signed a five-year contract for $75,000 a season and ten percent in the team's stock.
Both leagues agreed to try the new ""designated pinch hitter"" rule during spring training, but under two different variations. The American League allowed the optional use of a DPH only for the home team while the National League required home managers to obtain the visiting skipper's approval for the experimental substitution.
Bowie Kuhn, a forty-two year old lawyer whose firm had handled all of the National League's legal affairs was unanimously elected as the new Commissioner of Baseball. Two other top candidates; Mike Burke of the New York Yankees and Charles Feeney of the San Francisco Giants had been previously deadlocked resulting in Kuhn's nomination.
In an effort to prevent an impending strike, Major League Baseball and the Players Association finally settled on a new revised pension plan. The tenure for qualifying was shortened from five years to four and the minimum age requirement was also lowered from fifty to forty-five. The players also agreed to get $5.45 million per year (retroactive to 1959) as well as a percentage of all televised game revenues.
""I can't play anymore (retirement press conference on March 1, 1969). I can't hit the ball when I need to. I can't steal second when I need to. I can't go from first to third when I need to. I can't score from second when I need to. I have to quit."" - Mickey Mantle

On April 8, 1969, the expansion Seattle Pilots made their American League debut versus the California Angels and won 4-3 at Anaheim Stadium. Three days later, April 11, 1969, they played their first home game, in Sick's Stadium, and beat the White Sox 7-0!
On June 8, 1969, the New York Yankees retired Mickey Mantle's number 7 in front of 60,096 fans. During his on-field speech he said, ""Playing 18 years in Yankee Stadium for you folks was the best thing that could ever happen to a ballplayer.""
On September 26, 1969, Rod Carew attempted to tie the record for stealing home base during a season which was set during the 1912 season. Carew stole home safely against Skip Lockwood of Seattle, but during his slide he knocked over home plate umpire Jim Honochick who called Carew out then ejected him for throwing his equipment on the field.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1970 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After large numbers of North Vietnamese troops entered Cambodia in 1969. Premier Lon Nol assumed control of the government, while Prince Sihanouk was in Peking, and pledged to force the removal of the occupying military. Initially, the invaders agreed to withdraw, but then announced their support for Sihanouk, who had promised to fight the new government. President Nixon announced that U.S. troops would join with South Vietnamese troops to invade the border areas of Cambodia and eliminate all Communist sanctuaries.
Four students were killed at Kent State University after Ohio National Guardsmen clashed with anti-war protesters. The students were engaged in a rally condemning President Nixon's approval for a massive incursion into Cambodia. While appearing on television on April 30th, Nixon announced that the invasion was for a limited period, and was to save American lives, and claimed that American forces would not advance more than twenty-one miles into the country.
Monday Night Football debuted on ABC, with Howard Cosell, Keith Jackson, and Don Meredith all giving play-by-play. The on-camera camaraderie in the booth as well as the groundbreaking approach to covering the game resulted in the development of several multi-camera and play-by-play technologies that are still being used today. As a result, Monday Night Football has become the most successful and longest-running primetime sports series in television history.
In the American League...
Baltimore's Frank Robinson hit two successive grand slams during a 12-2 Orioles triumph over the Washington Senators becoming just the seventh major leaguer to ever accomplish the feat. The back-to-back historic blasts were the only grand slams Robinson ever hit as a ""Blackbird"".
The Kansas City Royals set an unwanted Major League mark on August 3rd after falling 10-8 to the Baltimore Orioles for the twenty-third time in two seasons.
Tommy Harper of the Milwaukee Brewers matched thirty stolen bases with his thirtieth home run of the year to become the fifth major leaguer to go 30-30 in the same season. Incidentally, the stats added up as the resulting 4-2 win over the Anaheim Angels marked the Brewers ""60th"" of the year.
In the National League...
On July 8th, San Francisco Giant Jim Ray Hart tied a modern Major League record with six runs batted in during one inning with all coming in the fifth. The ""bay area brawler"" slammed a three run home run and three run triple and eventually hit for the cycle en route to a 13-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.
The New York Mets' Tom Seaver set a Major League record after striking out nineteen Padres, including the last ten in succession, during an April 22nd, 2-1 victory over San Diego. The feat topped every pitcher ever to take the mound in the 20th Century and no one had ever struck out ten in a row to date.
Atlanta Braves icon ""Hammerin'"" Hank Aaron collected his three-thousandth hit with an infield single as well as his five-hundred seventieth home run off of Wayne Granger during a 7-6, 15-inning loss to the Cincinnati Reds on May 17th.
Around the League...
St. Louis Cardinals' Golden Glove outfielder Curt Flood filed a civil lawsuit against Major League Baseball in an effort to challenge their contract reserve clause. Flood refused to report to the Philadelphia Phillies after being traded and contended that the rule violated federal antitrust laws. Flood eventually lost his $4.1 million suit later in the year after Federal Judge Irving Ben Cooper upheld the legality of the clause. However, Cooper did recommend changes in the reserve system, to be achieved through negotiation between both players and owners.
""X-5"" baseballs, a new experimental brand claiming to travel faster and farther than traditional balls was field tested during all Major League Spring Training games in both Arizona and Florida. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered a halt to their use after a three week trial period, which had ended with inconclusive results.
All-Star Game voting was finally returned to the fans as punch-card ballots debuted in major league ballparks across the nation. It was the first time since 1958 that the exhibition's squads were not entirely selected by managers, coaches and players.
Both players and management agreed to end their labor dispute on June 8th by settling on a new standard contract. Among the compromises that benefited the players was a raise in the minimum league salary from $10,000 to $12,000 per season.
""To go to a game in Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, or Crosley Field in Cincinnati, or Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, or Shibe Park in Philadelphia, was to experience baseball intimately, and to be marinated in a sense of many summers lingering in the atmosphere.""

Is the ball juiced? On March 18, 1970 an experimental ball (dubbed X-5) was used in a Spring Training game. The Indians and Pilots had a combined 34 hits and Seattle won 19-14. Major League Baseball said the ball was only 5% livelier, but Sam McDowell disagreed saying in response to that claim, ""Times 100!""
On Opening Day at County Stadium in Milwaukee the Brewers played their first regular season game losing to the Angels 12-0. The game marked the return of American League baseball to the city of Milwaukee where it had been absent for 69 seasons.
On July 3, 1970, Clyde Wright threw the first ""California"" Angels no-hitter in team history. Follow the link if you do not remember who threw the first Angels no-hitter in franchise history.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1971 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On Thursday, September 9th, more than 1,200 inmates at Attica prison gained control of the facility in a well-planned and brutal attack. During the initial violence, fifty correctional officers and civilian employees were brutally beaten and taken prisoner. With hostages as leverage, the inmates listed twenty-eight demands they wanted met including amnesty for the crimes they had already committed when they took over the prison. After four tense days of unsuccessful negotiations, the command was given to retake the prison and rescue the hostages. With National Guard helicopters flying overhead administering chemical agents, a rescue force of nearly two-hundred New York State police officers stormed the facility. When it was over, ten hostages were dead, along with thirty-two inmates.
Cult-leader Charles Manson and several of his followers including Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, were convicted for the brutal Tate-LaBianca murders that occurred in August of 1969. Even though Manson was not physically present at the murders and his devotees attempted to assume full responsibility, he was seen as the malevolent power that influenced and directed their actions. All of the defendants were sentenced to death, but were later commuted to life after California's laws regarding the death penalty were changed.
Boxing legend, Muhammad Ali's draft evasion conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in June. The decision came four years after the ""People's Champion"" had refused to participate in the Vietnam War due to his Islamic faith. Despite citing religious reasons, Ali was denied status as a conscientious objector to the war and was subsequently convicted of refusing to be inducted into the armed forces. During the same year, Ali was stripped of his heavyweight boxing title and had his boxing license suspended.
In the American League...
On July 9th, the Oakland Athletics' Vida Blue tossed the longest shutout in American League history during a twenty inning, 1-0 triumph over the Anaheim Angels. The A's ace fanned seventeen batters in eleven innings while the Angels' Billy Cowan tied a Major League record by striking out six times. Both teams also combined to set a Major League record with forty-three K's.
The American League netted their only All-Star victory between 1962 and 1983 with a 6-4 victory over the Nationals. The outing appeared more like a home run derby though as Johnny Bench, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, Reggie Jackson, Frank Robinson, and Harmon Killebrew all hit round-trippers.
The Detroit Tigers proved the old adage that ""less is more"" after they tied a Major League record by using six different pinch hitters during the seventh inning while still losing 6-5 to the New York Yankees on September 5th.
In the National League...
On August 24th, Ernie Banks capped his legendary career with his 512th and final home run, launching a historic blast off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Jim McGlothlin during a thrilling 5-4 Cubs victory at Wrigley Field. The milestone shot propelled Banks past Mel Ott, securing an eighth-place tie with Eddie Mathews on baseball’s all-time home run leaderboard—a fitting final chapter for ""Mr. Cub.""
The Pittsburgh Pirates started what is believed to be the first all-minority line-up on September 1st as Rennie Stennett, Gene Clines, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Manny Sanguillen, Dave Cash, Al Oliver, Jackie Hernandez, Dock Ellis and Bob Veale all take the field for the ""Buccos"".
At the World Series, Roberto Clemente and Steve Blass combined on both sides of the plate for a 2-1, Game 7 victory that granted the Pirates their first World Championship title since 1960. After the game, some 40,000 ecstatic fans rioted in downtown Pittsburgh resulting in over one-hundred injuries and thousands of dollars in property damage.
Around the League...
On New Year's Day, the BBWAA failed to elect anyone during the annual Baseball Hall of Fame election. With two-hundred seventy votes required, the closest nominees were Yogi Berra with two-hundred forty-two and Early Wynn with two-hundred forty.
Boston's Carl Yastrzemski signed what is believed to be the richest player contract in baseball history at the time. The three-year agreement agreed to pay the Red Sox slugger an accumulated salary of $500,000.
Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn determined that players from the Negro Leagues would be given a full membership into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and not honored in a separate wing as originally announced.
Sixteen baseball researchers at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown formed the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), with founder Robert Davids as president. Currently SABR boasts over 7,000 members worldwide and has continually dedicated itself to the accurate preservation of America's national pastime.

On April 5, 1971, a baseball tradition will die. Opening Day ceremonies in Washington D.C. are the last of their kind and 45,061 fans were able to watch the Senators crush the Athletics 8-0.
Did you know that the best fielding third baseman in history once committed three errors during the same inning? On July 28, 1971, Brooks Robinson actually had a bad day during the sixth inning versus the Athletics. The eleven time consecutive Gold Glove winner would still win number twelve, but the moment is still a noteworthy part of his career.
On August 10, 1971, Harmon Killebrew of the Minnesota Twins joined the 500 Home Runs Club during his 6,671st at-bat, the fewest amount needed since Babe Ruth joined the club in 1929.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1972 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
LIFE, the blueprint for magazine publishing in America folded as a weekly in December of 1972. Though the weekly version's life span covered only thirty-seven years, it is impossible to think of any other magazine that had such an extraordinary impact on the art of photo-journalism. Debuting in 1936, Henry R. Luce and his colleagues at Time Inc. decided to publish a magazine that would take pictures and words to an unprecedented level. Up to then, most newsworthy imagery had been deliberately posed and static, but after the portable 35mm camera was developed in the 1930s, it was discovered that a skilled photographer could take pictures of almost anything, anywhere; at anytime. Most magazines had been built around editors and writers, but LIFE was very different, as it was entirely been built around its photographers.
President Richard Nixon defeated Democratic candidate George McGovern by one of the widest margins on record. However, within a few months, his administration was under fire over the so-called ""Watergate"" scandal, stemming from a break-in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee during the 1972 campaign. The break-in was traced to several officials of the Committee to Re-elect the President. As a result, many resigned and some were later convicted of offenses connected with efforts to cover up the affair. Nixon himself denied any personal involvement, but the courts forced him to yield White House tape recordings, which indicated that he had, in fact, tried to interfere with the ongoing investigation.
In the American League...
On May 12th, the Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins went head-to-head for twenty-one innings before the one A.M. curfew halted play with the score 3-3. Both teams combined to tie the Major League record for intentional walks during an extra-inning game with seven and the Twins went a step further and tied their own club record by stranding twenty-three men on base. The following day play resumed as the Brewers scored in the top of the twenty-second to win 4-3, but the Twins prevailed with a 4-3 victory of their own in the second outing after fifteen innings. At the end of the day, both games tallied nine hours and twenty-three minutes setting an American League record for the most consecutive innings ever played in a two-day span.
June 4th belonged to the pitchers as a Major League record eight shutouts were pitched in sixteen games. Five took place in the American League and three in the National League with two being recorded by the Oakland Athletics who swept the Baltimore Orioles twice with a pair of identical 2-0 decisions.
California Angels' ace Nolan Ryan sat down sixteen batters for a 3-0 victory and an American League record with eight K's in a row on nine pitches. Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox, managed a one-out single in the first for the team's only hit, but Ryan responded by retiring the last twenty-six consecutive batters. In doing so, the future Hall of Famer became only the third pitcher in Major League history to twice fan the side on nine pitches.
In the National League...
Giants' giant Willie McCovey tied both Gil Hodges and Hank Aaron for the National League grand-slam record with fourteen of his own as San Francisco beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 9-3.
On September 30th, Roberto Clemente doubled to left-center off of the New York Mets' John Matlack at Three Rivers Stadium for his final at-bat and career hit number three-thousand. The Pittsburgh Pirates went on to win 5-0 and ""The Great One"" went on the list with Ty Cobb, Stan Musial, Tris Speaker, Honus Wagner, Hank Aaron, Eddie Collins, Napoleon Lajoie, Willie Mays, Paul Waner, and Adrian Anson as the newest member of the ""3,000 hit club"".
Unfortunately, Clemente was killed in a plane crash while on a humanitarian mission that was taking supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. The DC-7 aircraft he was flying in went down off the coast of Puerto Rico one-mile from San Juan with no survivors. The four time National League batting champion was only thirty-eight years old and had just won a World Series championship in 1971. As a tribute, he was elected on a special consideration to the National Baseball Hall of Fame with a 93% vote becoming the first Latin American to be inducted into Cooperstown.
Around the League...
Eighty-six games were cancelled due to the first general players' strike, which was eventually resolved on April 13th. Concessions came after both the owners and players agreed on a $500,000 increase in pension fund payments. In an effort to prevent paying the players for the work stoppage, the league decided not to make up the missed contests. As a result, some teams only played one-hundred fifty-three total games.
The Philadelphia Phillies' Steve Carlton became the first pitcher at 27-10, to win the Cy Young Award while playing with a last-place team and Rod Carew, of the Minnesota Twins, became the first American League player to lead the league in hitting without ever hitting a single home run.
The Oakland Athletics' Reggie Jackson set a new trend in baseball after being the first Major League ballplayer to wear a mustache since Wally Schang in 1914. As a result, the A's owner Charles Finley declared June 18th ""Mustache Day"" at the ballpark and offered $300 to each player that could grow one before Father's Day.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed lower court rulings in the Curt Flood case by a vote of 5-3 upholding baseball's exemption from antitrust laws. The decision cleared the way for future legislation or collective bargaining to undercut the reserve system, but proved meaningless after all major league owners agreed to salary arbitration at the end of the season.
""The only difference between me and those other great Yankees is my skin color."" - Reggie Jackson

On July 14, 1972, Bill Haller was the plate umpire in a Tigers versus Royals game. The Detroit catcher that day was Tom Haller, the brother of the umpire, making this the first time in history that such an event took place.
On August 23, 1972, Dick Allen of the White Sox became the fourth player to hit a ball into the centerfield bleachers at Comiskey Park. The other three were Hank Greenberg, Jimmie Foxx, and Alex Johnson.
On October 2, 1972, Terry Forster of the White Sox stole second base and remained the last American League pitcher to steal a base until interleague play began during the 1997 season.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1973 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
NASA launched the Skylab Space Station, a science and engineering laboratory, into orbit aboard a Saturn V rocket on May 14th. Three crews of three astronauts each visited the station on missions lasting twenty-eight, fifty-nine and eighty-four days. Many UV astronomy experiments and detailed X-ray studies of the Sun were executed before the station fell from orbit in July of 1979.
Vice President Spiro Agnew came under investigation by the U.S. attorney in Baltimore for allegedly receiving payoffs from engineers seeking contracts when Agnew the governor of Maryland. Although he maintained his innocence, Agnew eventually resigned from office on October 10, 1973, and pleaded no contest, to a single charge that he had failed to report $29,500 of income received in 1967. Following his resignation, Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' probation.
The United States completed its withdrawal from Vietnam in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords. Under its terms, there would be a ceasefire, U.S. troops would agree to leave the country and all prisoners of war would be released. Two years later, the Communists achieved total victory in Vietnam.
In the American League...
The American Leagues' two premiere catchers Carlton Fisk, of the Boston Red Sox, and Thurman Munson, of the New York Yankees squared off after the Bombers captain barreled into Fisk while trying to score from third on a missed bunt by teammate Gene Michael. The fight was fueled both the legendary rivalry between the two teams and the genuine dislike between the two players. Although the winner of the brawl remained undetermined, the winner of the game went to the Red Sox 3-2.
Frank Robinson, of the California Angels, homered against the Texas Rangers at Arlington Stadium giving him at least one career home run in all thirty-two Major League ballparks.
Fellow Angel Nolan Ryan set a Major League record on his last pitch of the year after striking out the Minnesota Twins' Rich Reese for his three-hundred eighty-third K of the season. The Anaheim crowd gave Ryan a five minute standing ovation and the veteran ace returned the gesture with a 5-4 decision for his twenty-first win of the season.
In the National League...
On August 17th, Willie Mays hit his six-hundred sixtieth (and final) home run off of the Cincinnati Reds' Don Gullett. Unfortunately the New York Mets fell 2-1, remaining seven and a half games back in last place. Somehow, Yogi Berra and his ""Miracle"" Mets managed to climb back to the top and won the National League East pennant on October 1st despite having no .300 hitters and no pitchers with more than nineteen wins.
Phil Neikro became the first Atlanta Braves pitcher ever to toss a no-hitter after dominating the San Diego Padres for a 9-0 triumph while walking three batters and fanning four. Two days later the Braves signed his younger brother, Joe from the Detroit Tigers reuniting the brothers for the first time in the majors.
Wilbur Wood attempted to set a record while starting both games of a doubleheader between his Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees, but it backfired completely as ""the Iron Man wannabe"" was taken for a 12-2 and 7-0 loss.
Around the League...
A group of seventeen investors led by Ohio Shipbuilder George Steinbrenner purchased the New York Yankees from the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS) for a reported $10 million dollars. The television giant was forced to take a $4 million dollar loss in the deal while Steinbrenner went on to become the owner of one of the largest market teams in all professional sports.
At a joint meeting of all twenty-four Major League owners, a unanimous decision was made to allow the use of the ""Designated Hitter"" in the American League for a three season probationary period. The experiment marked the first time since 1901 that the National and American Leagues played under different rules. The concept of interleague play was also submitted for committee review.
Both players and owners agreed to what was coined as the ""10 and 5 rule"" in which a player with a decade of experience in the majors and five-years with their present team could veto a trade. The league minimum salary was also raised to $15,000 and all salary disputes were to be from then on arbitrated. These amendments prevented an impending strike and allowed the start of the spring training season.
Eleven weeks after his untimely death in a plane crash, Pittsburgh Pirate legend Roberto Clemente was voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame during a special election that superseded the five-year waiting period. Clemente was on a humanitarian mission that was taking supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua when the aircraft he was flying in went down off the coast of Puerto Rico. ""The Great One"" as he was called, represented the first Latin American to be inducted into Cooperstown after receiving 93% of the four-hundred twenty-four ballots cast and his lifetime batting average of .317 is still the highest of any right-hander since World War II.
""I hope it (the designated hitter 'experiment') works. I would have preferred that both leagues did it, but if it's successful in one, then I hope the National follows suit."" - Commissioner Bowie Kuhn

On April 6, 1973, Ron Blomberg (New York Yankees) became the first designated hitter in American League history.
Do you remember which pitcher threw the first no-hitter in Kansas City Royals history? It happened on April 27, 1973 in Tiger Stadium, Jim Perry was the losing pitcher, and the box score is on Baseball Almanac.
Nolan Ryan, who pitched two no-hitters in 1973, had another memorable game on September 27, 1973. During that game versus the Twins, Ryan struck out Steve Brye during the eighth inning to tie Sandy Koufax's single season record for strikeouts (382). In the eleventh inning, with two outs and two strikes on Rich Reese, Ryan fired his last pitch of the season and fanned Reese to set a new single season strikeout record.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1974 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On August 8th, 1974 Richard Nixon became the first President in U.S. history to resign. His decision to step down came as the House of Representatives was poised to vote on the articles of impeachment against him due to his involvement the Watergate scandal.
Patricia Hearst, the heiress to the Hearst fortune, was kidnapped by a radical terrorist group called the ""Symbionese Liberation Army"" resulting in one of the largest manhunts of all time. While under control of the S.L.A., she was brainwashed and forced to rob a bank while protecting her ""comrades in arms."" After she was found, Hearst was convicted for grand theft and served almost two years of a seven-year prison term. Finally, she was released with help from President Jimmy Carter and two decades later, President Bill Clinton granted her a full pardon.
Charles A. Lindbergh, the first man to fly across the Atlantic (from New York-to-Paris) in 1927 aboard the ""Spirit of St. Louis"", died of cancer of the lymphatic system. The aviation pioneer had become a recluse after retiring to the island of Kipahulu, Hawaii where he developed an active concern with conservation. Upon hearing of his death, President Ford stated the courage and daring of his historic flight would never be forgotten and that he would be remembered as one of America's all-time heroes.
In the American League...
""Ten-Cent Beer Night"" in Cleveland backfired after drunken and disorderly fans stumbled onto the field of play causing the Indians to forfeit the game to the Texas Rangers. With a five-all score in the ninth, Tribe fans poured onto the field and surrounded outfielder Jeff Burroughs while trying to take his hat and glove for souvenirs. After players from both sides rushed to his aid, the game was called in favor of the visitors.
Principal New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was suspended for two years by the Commissioner's Office after he was convicted in federal court for making illegal contributions to the re-election campaign of President Richard Nixon.
The Oakland Athletics' Gene Tenace proved that it's not always what you do, but sometimes what you don't. Tenace tied a 1930 mark set by John Clancy of the Chicago White Sox in which the first baseman played an entire nine-innings without ever having a fielding chance.
In the National League...
On Thursday April 4th, Hank Aaron hit a three-run homer off of Jack Billingham as the Atlanta Braves lost to the Reds 7-6, at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium. The eleven inning game itself took a backseat to ""Hammerin'"" Hank, who had finally tied Babe Ruth with home run number 714. Both Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Vice-president Gerald Ford were on hand to congratulate the slugger who had persevered over racial prejudice and death threats from several fans who did not want to see the Bambino's record fall to a black man. Four days later, back home at Fulton County Stadium, Aaron hit number 715 off Los Angeles Dodgers' lefty, Al Downing. Lost in the celebration was Aaron's tying of Willie Mays' National League record of 2,063 runs as well as his team's 7-4 victory.
The Mets lost 4-3 to the Cardinals during a ""long-distance"" marathon night game on September 11th. After seven hours and twenty-five innings, the outing became the longest game to a decision in Major League history. In the end, New York had batted one-hundred three times and St. Louis was not far behind with ninety-nine plate appearances. A record one-hundred seventy-five official at-bats were recorded, with a Major League record of forty-five runners left stranded. Despite the historical moment, only a thousand fans were on hand when it finally ended at 3:13 a.m.
On June 29th, Lou Brock nabbed his seven-hundredth bag at Wrigley Field as the St. Louis Cardinals crushed the hometown ""Cubbies"" 11-2. Brock's sixty-fifth robbery of the season put him in the company of baseball's greatest ""criminals"" including Ty Cobb, who stole eight-hundred ninety-two bases, Eddie Collins (seven-hundred forty-three), Max Carey (seven-hundred thirty-eight) and Honus Wagner (seven-hundred one).
Around the League...
Forty-eight major leaguers opted to try the new arbitration procedure that had been established to aid in the negotiation of contract differences. The first to file was Minnesota pitcher Dick Woodson, who was seeking an agreement worth $29,000. The Twins had offered $23,000 and both parties presented their arguments to a Detroit lawyer and labor arbitrator Harry H. Platt. After reviewing the monetary amounts presented, the verdict was cast in Woodson's favor.
A new organization known as the ""Major League Scouting Bureau"" was founded to cut expenditures across the league by centralizing scouting. Initially, membership was not mandatory (until 1984) resulting in only seventeen of twenty-four teams agreeing to pay the $118,000 fee for inclusion. All American League clubs except the White Sox and Toronto joined and only the Cubs, Expos, Pirates, Braves, Astros and the Reds represented the National League.
To prevent the sale of ""counterfeit"" memorabilia, a system was developed to maintain the integrity of authentic baseballs during Hank Aaron's quest for Babe Ruth's home run record. After Aaron's 710th round-tripper, all official major league balls issued were ""encoded"" with a special serial number and a diamond symbol that was only visible under fluorescent light.
Twenty-seven years after Jackie Robinson first entered the majors, Frank Robinson became Major League Baseball's first black manager. The thirty-nine year old player / manager signed a $175,000 contract with the Cleveland Indians making him the team's twenty-eighth skipper. Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announced that it should have taken place much sooner and Robinson stated that his only wish was that Jackie could have been there to share in the moment.
""I used to think Al Kaline could hit .400, or (Mickey) Mantle, but Mantle missed the ball too much. Too many strikeouts. He was forever going for the long ball, even with two strikes. Not quite enough finesse. And time ran out on Kaline and (Willie) Mays."" - Ted Williams in My Turn at Bat (1988)

Did you know that on Opening Day in 1974 the New York Yankees played their home opener in Shea Stadium because Yankee Stadium was being remodeled?
In 1946 Bob Feller's fastball was clocked at 98.6 miles per hour (some sources claim it was 107 miles per hour) using a military measuring device. On August 20, 1974, Nolan Ryan's fastball was clocked at 100.9 miles per hour using a modern radar device during a game versus the Tigers. Ryan, who struck out nineteen batters, lost the game 1-0 to Mickey Lolich.
On September 24, 1974, Al Kaline hit a shot down the right field line during the fourth inning versus Dave McNally of the Orioles. That double put Kaline in company with 11 other 3,000 Hit Club members! Eight days later the Tiger legend announced his retirement from the game.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1990 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Hubble Space Telescope was originally due to be launched in 1986, but the explosion
of the Space Shuttle Challenger delayed the launch until April of 1990. The twelve-ton telescope was equipped with a ninety-four inch mirror and was sent into orbit by the astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. Within two months, a flaw in the mirror was discovered, placing in jeopardy the largest investment ever in astronomy. Three years later, the defect was finally repaired by specialists aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor who restored the telescope to its full optical capabilities.
Microsoft Corporation introduced their new operating system Windows 3.0 which featured a graphical user interface similar to the Macintosh platform from Apple. The PC version of the software was geared towards the novice home user and forever changed the world of personal computers. Some of the new features included the use of a mouse, which allowed the user to navigate the screen with a pointer and manipulate data with one hand.
America's favorite dysfunctional cartoon family, The Simpsons debuted as a half hour-comedy on the FOX Network. Created by Matt Groening in 1987, the characters of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie were featured as thirty-second spots on The Tracey Ullman Show before going solo in 1990. The controversial series had been repeatedly confirmed by fans and critics to be one of the most humorous and lifelike portraits of the average American family and it received the 1990 and 1991 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program.
In the American League...
The Seattle Mariner's Randy Johnson tossed the franchise's first no-hitter with a 2-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers. The ""Big Unit"", who earned his nickname as the tallest pitcher in Major League history at six feet ten inches, struck out eight batters and walked six with fifty of his pitches clocked at ninety-four miles per hour or above.
As a tribute to days gone by, the Chicago White Sox held a throwback tribute to honor their 1917 World Championship team. The players donned old-fashioned uniforms and the promoters at Comiskey Park scaled all concessions back to World War I prices. The home team went on to lose 12-9 at the hands of the Milwaukee Brewers in a thirteen inning nail-biter.
The Minnesota Twins set a Major League record by pulling off two triple plays in the same game, one in the fourth and another in the eighth. Both were started on grounders to third baseman Gary Gaetti who had started five of the Twins' last six triple efforts. Despite the record, the Red Sox went on to win 1-0. The following day both teams combined to set yet another major league mark for defensive plays when Boston hit into six double plays and Minnesota grounded into four. The previous mark of nine double plays was last accomplished on April 15, 1961.
In the National League...
The National League announced it plans to expand from twelve to fourteen teams for the 1993 season opening the doors for expansion franchises in Denver and Miami. The price of admission into the National League was set at a whopping ninety-five million dollars.
Eddie Murray of the Los Angeles Dodgers homered from both sides of the plate during a 6-2 win over the San Francisco Giants. In doing so he became the first major leaguer to pull the feat in both the National and American Leagues.
Chicago Cubs' ace Greg Maddux set a Major League record for pitchers when he recorded seven putouts in a 4-0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Over the course of the season he recorded thirty-nine putouts for the year to tie Vic Willis for the National League mark set in 1904. Maddux went on to match it again both in 1991 and 1993.
Around the league...
The Boston Red Sox hired Elaine Weddington as their newest assistant General Manager, making her the highest-ranking black female in the major leagues.
The Major League owners unanimously refused to open Spring Training camps without a new Basic Agreement with the Players' Association. The standoff resulted in a thirty-two day lockout that postponed the start of the regular season by one week.
Both players and owners eventually reached a collective-bargaining agreement that increased the clubs' contributions to the players' pension fund, raised the minimum major league salary to $100,000 and also set a compromise on salary arbitration that left seventeen percent of the players with two and three years experience eligible.
On April 10th, President George Bush Sr. became the first U.S. president to throw out a first pitch on foreign soil after he was invited to the Toronto home opener by the Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The Blue Jays later went on to beat the Texas Rangers (who were owned by a group led by George Bush Jr.) by a score of 2-1.

The ""year of the no-hitter"" started on June 11, 1990, when Nolan Ryan tossed his sixth gem — this time versus the Oakland Athletics.
Did you know that on August 31, 1990, Ken Griffey and Ken Griffey, Jr. became the first father and son to play together as Major League teammates?
On September 2, 1990, Dave Stieb of Toronto threw the first Blue Jay no-hitter in franchise history. It was also the ninth and final no-hitter thrown during 1990.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1991 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
In February, the Gulf War conflict between Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and a coalition of thirty-two nations including the United States, Britain, Egypt, France, and Saudi Arabia took place. The main coalition forces invaded southern Iraq on February 24 and, over the next four days, encircled and defeated the Iraqis while liberating Kuwait. By the time U.S. President George Bush Sr. declared a cease-fire on February 28, most of Hussein's forces had either surrendered or fled.
The ""Cold War"" between the United States and Russia finally came to an end as Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was ousted by a group of communist radicals. The ill-planned coup soon faltered as infuriated citizens took to the streets of Moscow and other cities in support of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. After Gorbachev reluctantly resigned, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved and fourteen regions became independent nations ending seventy-four years of communist rule.
Basketball icon Magic Johnson stunned the world shortly before the start of the 1991 season after announcing his retirement due to testing positive to the HIV Virus. He later accepted an invitation by the NBA players to his twelfth All-Star Game in which he won the MVP honors.
In the American League...
The Detroit Tigers' Cecil Fielder hit a 502-foot home run out of the Milwaukee Brewers' County Stadium, for what was believed to be the first ball ever truly knocked ""out of the park"". The tape measure blast traveled even further after it landed in the back of a truck that didn't stop until it reached Madison.
On June 6th, the Kansas City Royals and Texas Rangers combined for eighteen-innings to tie a Major League mark by leaving forty-five stranded runners on base. The Royals also set an American League record with twenty-five of the ""castaways"" belonging to them.
Thirty-nine year-old Dave Winfield went five-for-five and hit for the cycle as the California Angels defeated the Kansas City Royals 9-4. He completed the sequence in the eighth with a triple becoming the oldest player ever to accomplish the feat.
In the National League...
Darryl Strawberry tied a National League record by striking out five times in a single game as his Los Angeles Dodgers fell 9-3 to the Montreal Expos. The struggling slugger also stumbled in the outfield dropping a fly ball for a three-base error.
Atlanta Braves ace Tom Glavine won a league leading twenty games for the first time in his Hall of Fame career. His nine complete games were tied for first, and he finished third in strikeouts and earned run average, on his way to his first-of-two career Cy Young Awards.
Fellow Brave Otis Nixon set a new National League record by stealing six bases during a 7-6 loss to the Montreal Expos and tied the major league record previously set by Eddie Collins, who did it twice in 1912.
Around the league...
Pete Rose continued to make headlines when he was released from a federal prison after serving five months for tax evasion. He was also required to provide 1,000 hours of community service at several of Cincinnati's inner-city schools.
The Major League's Umpires Union voted to sit out Opening Day resulting in amateur officials reporting as replacements. The arbiters, whose contract had expired on December 31st, returned to work the following day with better benefits and an increased starting salary.
During a straw vote held at the owner's meetings in California, the National League voted unanimously to admit Denver, Colorado and Miami, Florida into the league as expansion teams in 1993.
The Committee for Statistical Accuracy righted a thirty year wrong after officially removing the asterisk attached to Roger Maris' single-season homerun record of 61 in 1961. The committee also defined a no-hit game as one; which ends after nine or more innings with one team failing to get a hit. The decision erased fifty games (mostly shortened) from the list that had previously been considered no-hitters.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1992 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
South-Central Los Angeles burned amidst several days of rioting, following a jury's acquittal of white L.A. police officers that had been videotaped beating a black motorist named Rodney King. The violent protest was the worst civil disobedience incident since the Watts Riots of 1964 and resulted in $785 million in property damage.
America's most notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal, was sentenced to fifteen life terms (957 years) in prison for the vicious torture and murder of seventeen young men. He himself was murdered in prison by a fellow inmate on November 28, 1994.
Hurricane Andrew, the most destructive United States hurricane of record (a category four), caused twenty-three deaths in the U.S. and three more in the Bahamas. The massive storm had a peak gust of 164 mph and caused $26.5 billion in damage.
In the American League...
Oakland Athletics outfielder and perennial base thief Rickey Henderson snatched the 1,000th base of his career in the first inning of the A's 7-6 win over the Detroit Tigers.
Nolan Ryan, of the Texas Rangers, struck out his 100th batter for a record twenty-third year in a row. In doing so, he passed Phil Niekro as number twelve on the all-time win list with three-hundred nineteen victories.
Milwaukee Brewer Robin Yount reached the 3,000th hit of his career as his team lost 5-4 against the Cleveland Indians. He also became the second player in Major League history (behind Willie Mays) to record two-hundred home runs, two-hundred stolen bases and one-hundred triples.
In the National League...
Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke became the first outfielder in nearly eighteen years to record an unassisted double play. As the Pirates took on the Houston Astros, Van Slyke made a running catch in shallow center followed by a tag on Ken Caminiti, who was running from second base on the play.
Los Angeles Dodger Kevin Gross dominated the mound after tossing ninety-nine pitches (seventy-one for strikes) in a no-hitter, 2-0 triumph over the San Francisco Giants.
Eddie Murray topped the New York Yankees' Mickey Mantle for the most RBIs ever by a switch-hitter (1,510) after blasting two home two runs in the Mets 15-1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Around the league...
Tom Seaver and Rollie Fingers were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame while Pete Rose, ineligible because of his ban from baseball for allegedly betting on games, surprisingly received forty-one write-in votes.
Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan petitioned the baseball owners for permission to purchase the Seattle Mariners. The owners approved the request 25-1 marking the first non-North American ownership of a Major League team.
Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered the realignment of the National League moving the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals into the Western Division. Later in the season, the owners voted 18-9 (with one abstention) calling for Vincent's resignation and the Commissioner obliged them three days after failing to receive a vote of confidence. Baseball's executive council rescinded the National League realignment following Vincent's departure.
In November, baseball held an expansion draft, resulting in seventy-two selections, to fill the rosters of the National League's two newest teams, the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1993 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
On February 26, 1993 more than 1,000 lb. of explosives shook the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York leaving six people dead and over one thousand injured. The incident marked the first time in modern history that a terrorist attack was launched on American soil. Unfortunately, it would not be the last.
After an unsuccessful raid by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on David Koresh's Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, the FBI and U.S. Army took over, mounting a fifty-one day siege. The standoff ended in tragedy when a fire broke out as government agents attempted to storm the compound. In the end, all seventy four cult members inside perished.
An attempt by a U.S. Special Forces team (including Delta Force and Army Rangers) to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord in Mogadishu, Somalia resulted in the downing of two Black Hawk helicopters and the longest sustained firefight involving American troops since the Vietnam War. The following morning, eighteen Americans were dead and more than seventy were badly injured.
In the American League...
Carlos Baerga became the first switch-hitter in Major League history to homer from both sides of the plate in the same inning as the Cleveland Indians topped the New York Yankees 15-5.
Kansas City's Greg Gagne belted the 10,000th hit in the history of Detroit's Tiger Stadium, making it the first ballpark to reach that figure. The Royals went on to defeat the home team 12-6.
Carlton Fisk, then with the Chicago White Sox, played in his 2,226 and final Major League game, surpassing Bob Boone's record for the most games caught. Following the historical outing, Fisk reluctantly retired with 3,999 total bases, the most ever for a catcher.
In the National League...
The Pittsburgh Pirate's Tim Wakefield set the record for the most pitches thrown in a single game in the 1990s. The Bucco's knuckler tossed one-hundred seventy-two en route to a 6-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves. The last pitcher to match Wakefield was the Los Angeles Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela in 1987.
On July 7th, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies went head-to-head in a twenty-inning marathon that lasted six hours and ten minutes. The grueling contest finally ended after Lenny Dykstra hit a clutch, bases-loaded two-run double off Rod Nichols for the 7-6 finale.
The San Diego Padres appointed a twenty-nine year-old named Randy Smith as their new Vice President of Baseball Operations and General Manager, making him the youngest General Manager in the history of Major League Baseball.
Around the league...
The Reverend Jesse Jackson accused baseball owners of discrimination practices and threatened to start a selective boycott unless a plan to hire more minorities for front-office jobs was in place by April 5.
Marge Schott, the Cincinnati Reds owner, was fined $25,000 by the commissioner's office and banned for an entire season after several complaints were filed accusing her of using of ethnic and racial slurs.
George Steinbrenner was finally able to resume his role as general partner of the New York Yankees after a suspension from baseball due to questionable dealings with renowned gambler Howard Spira.
In an effort to broaden both leagues and expand post-season opportunities, a vote was cast to divide both the American and National into three divisions and add another round of playoffs featuring two additional wild-card teams.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1994 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
A major earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter Scale, struck the densely populated San Fernando Valley in northern Los Angeles. In the aftermath, fifty-seven people were killed, 1,500 were injured and over 12,500 buildings were damaged.
Richard M. Nixon, the thirty-seventh President of the United States, who won a record landslide and resigned in disgrace twenty-one months later died after suffering a stroke at the age of eighty-one.
U.S. national champion figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, a 1992 Olympic bronze medalist and one of the favorites to win the gold medal, was attacked after a practice at the U.S. Olympic trials. It was later discovered that one of her rivals, Tonya Harding and her husband were behind the plot.
In the American League...
Cleveland Indians pitcher Paul Shuey went four (K's) for four in the ninth inning of the Tribe's 9-3 win over the Detroit Tigers. In doing so he became only the tenth pitcher in American League history, (and the first rookie) to strike out four batters in a single inning.
The Twins' Pedro Munoz drove in seven runs to defeat the Detroit Tigers 21-7 as Minnesota became the first team since the 1950 Red Sox to score more than twenty runs in a game, two times in the same season. Their previous rally was a 21-2 homerun derby over the Boston Red Sox.
Kevin Appier, of the Kansas City Royals, set an all-time record (traced back to 1986) after striking out thirteen Texas Rangers in only five and 2/3 innings of work. To date, no pitcher, in the history of baseball had ever pitched less than six innings in a game with that many strikeouts.
In the National League...
The Chicago Cubs' Tuffy Rhodes became the first National League player to tally three home runs (all consecutive) on Opening Day at Wrigley Field. Despite the setback, Dwight Gooden and the New York Mets held on to beat the home team 12-8.
The St. Louis Cardinals set a new major-league record by stranding sixteen base runners in a 4-0 shutout by the Philadelphia Phillies. After eight innings, the game remained scoreless, but reliever Mike Perez stumbled in the ninth surrendering two hits, one walk and a three-run homer.
Jeff Bagwell became the twenty-eighth player in Major League history to homer twice in the same inning as Houston rallied for nine runs in the sixth during a 16-4 massacre over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Around the League...
The Major League Players Association rejected an owner's salary cap proposal, asking players to split all revenues 50-50. In addition, the citation stated that salary arbitration would be eliminated and free agency for players could be reached after four years in the majors instead of six.
As negotiations continued to heat up, the owners decided to withhold $7.8 million that they were obligated to pay into the players' pension and benefit plans. The final straw fell after the Senate Judiciary Committee failed to approve an antitrust legislation that left the players with little choice but to strike.
On September 14th, the remainder of the baseball season was canceled thirty-four days into the players' strike. As a result, the World Series was also called off for the first time since 1904. Three months later, the owners unilaterally implemented a salary cap as negotiations remained at a standstill.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1995 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
A massive bomb inside a rental truck exploded outside the Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, demolishing half of the nine-story structure and killing one-hundred sixty-eight people. Timothy McVeigh, a former U.S. soldier turned domestic terrorist, was later convicted and sentenced to death for his crime in 1997.
Big business got even bigger in 1995 as several mega-media companies merged including ABC and Disney, Westinghouse and CBS and Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner.
Pro Football Hall of Famer and television celebrity O. J. Simpson went on trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The media circus surrounding the event as well as one-hundred thirty-three days of televised courtroom testimony turned countless viewers into Simpson trial junkies.
In the American League...
The ""Iron Man"" finally roped the ""Iron Horse"" as Baltimore Oriole Cal Ripken Jr. matched Yankee great Lou Gehrig by appearing in his 2,130th consecutive game. The amazing record spanned 16½ years and validated the shortstop as modern baseball's most durable, hard-working and determined player. Amidst a finale of fireworks, play is stopped for twenty-two minutes as Ripken takes a celebratory lap around Camden Yards.
On September 8th, the Cleveland Indians clinched the American League Central Division after their one-hundred twenty-third game of the season. The feat marked the fastest that any team had ever won a title and moved the Tribe ahead in the American League race by a staggering 23½ games over their closest competitor, the Kansas City Royals.
The Boston Red Sox defeated the New York Yankees, 8-0 as the Beantown Bombers scored all eight of their runs on grand slams in back-to-back innings (John Valentin and Mo Vaughn). According to a SABR statistician, it was the only game ever to finish with two grand slams accounting for all of the runs scored.
In the National League...
Hideo Nomo became the first Japanese player to appear in the Major Leagues since 1964 when he tossed five innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers in a 13-inning, 4-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants.
On May 6th, seven National League games resulted in a combined one-hundred eighteen runs that tied the record for the highest-scoring day in National League history. Seven of the fourteen teams scored at least ten runs, led by the Los Angeles Dodgers who totaled seventeen in their win over the Colorado Rockies. Ten days later, the Chicago Cubs, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, and Pittsburgh Pirates all tossed shutouts.
The St. Louis Cardinals were awarded the first forfeit victory in the Major Leagues since July 12, 1979 after fans bombard the field with more than two-hundred balls that they had received as souvenirs for August 10th's ""Ball Day"" at Dodger Stadium. The near riot was in reaction to the ejections of Raul Mondesi and manager Tommy Lasorda in the bottom of the ninth.
Around the League...
The '94 strike continued into the '95 season as the players' union chief Donald Fehr declared all eight-hundred thirty-five unsigned Major League players to be free agents in response to unilateral contract changes made by the owners. Five bills aimed at ending the baseball strike were introduced into Congress and both players and owners were ordered by President Clinton to resume bargaining and reach an agreement by February 6. After the deadline passed with no compromises, the use of replacement players for spring training and regular season games was approved by baseball's executive council. Finally on April 25th, the two-hundred thirty-four day strike ended although the opening games were played with replacement umpires. The regular officials continued to be locked out until May 3rd.
In September, a three-judge panel in New York voted unanimously to uphold the injunction that brought the end to the strike. Although the owners had appealed the decision, the panel determined that the Players Relations Committee had illegally attempted to eliminate free agency and salary arbitration.
The Commerce Comet, baseball legend Mickey Mantle died at age sixty-three in Dallas, Texas. The Mick had recently received a liver transplant at Baylor University Hospital and during the surgical procedure doctor's discovered that he had contracted an inoperable form of liver cancer.
In September Major League Baseball signed a $1.7 billion, five year deal with Fox, NBC, ESPN, and Liberty Media.
""You are challenged by the game of baseball to do your very best, day in and day out, and that's all I've ever tried to do."" - Cal Ripken, Jr.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1996 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After years of investigation, federal law enforcement officials finally captured the Unabomber otherwise known as Ted Kaczynski. The anti-social academic, who developed mail bombs, was captured in a remote cabin after his own brother recognized his writing style in a lengthy manifesto that he anonymously submitted to the Washington Post.
The Summer Olympic Games celebrated its Centenary in Atlanta Georgia as a record-setting seventy-nine nations won medals and fifty-three won gold. Unfortunately, the festivities were interrupted after a terrorist bomb was detonated in Centennial Olympic Park killing one person and injuring one-hundred ten more.
After capturing an unprecedented third straight U.S. Amateur in August, twenty year-old Tiger Woods turned pro and promptly won two tourneys for $790,594. Sports Illustrated selected Woods as the 1996 Sportsman of the Year and he was only getting started.
In the American League...
The Texas Rangers showed no mercy in running up the largest score in the American League in forty-one years while massacring the league-leading Baltimore Orioles, 26-7. Sixteen of the runs came in the fifty-six minute eighth resulting in the largest eighth inning tally in baseball history.
As the Seattle Mariners hosted the Cleveland Indians on May 2nd, an earthquake, measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale, rattled the Kingdome causing the officials to suspend the game. The incident occurred in the seventh inning as the Tribe led 6-3 and after the stadium's structure was thoroughly inspected, play resumed the following day.
The Oakland Athletics' Pedro Munoz hit the longest home run in the five-year history of Camden Yards on the way to a 6-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles. The 463-foot blast to dead center field came in the sixth inning (with two on) breaking through a 2-2 tie.
In the National League...
New York Mets closer John Franco recorded his 300th save in a 3-2 win over the division-leading Montreal Expos. The left-handed reliever became the first to reach the 300-save mark exactly twelve years to the day (April 29th) after his first one, for the Cincinnati Reds, in 1984.
Los Angeles Dodger, Chan Ho Park became the first South Korean pitcher to win in the majors. The right-handed sensation from Kongju tossed four scoreless innings in relief of injured starter Ramon Martinez for the 3-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.
Eric Davis belted his second grand slam in as many games leading the Cincinnati Reds to a 12-6 triumph over the home team San Francisco Giants. In doing so, the outfielder became the fifteenth player in Major League history to slam round-trippers in back-to-back outings and he went on to add a third slam later in the month.
Around the League...
Prior to the start of the season, major league baseball's Rules Committee announced that the strike zone would be enlarged, dropping it from the top of the knees to just below them. The change came in response to a series of recommendations to help speed up play and increase the television viewing audience that was rapidly depleting.
Popular umpire John McSherry died of a massive heart attack after calling time from behind home plate seven pitches into a Reds-Expos game at Riverfront Stadium. The twenty-one year veteran had been suffering from a series of medical problems that was aggravated by his obesity.
Roberto Alomar set off a national debate after spitting in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck following an argument and ejection over a called strike in the first inning of Baltimore's game against the Toronto Blue Jays. U.S. District Judge Edmund W. Ludwig later prevented other umpires from sitting out the playoffs in protest of the incident, citing a no-strike clause in their contract.
Milt Gaston, a former American League pitcher who played for five teams in the 1920s and 1930s (Yankees, Browns, Nationals, Red Sox, White Sox) died at age one-hundred. Gaston boasted eighteen Hall of Fame teammates and managers, more than any player in history of the game.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1997 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Lady Diana, the Princess of Wales, and her male companion Dodi Fayed died in a fatal car accident near the River Seine in Paris, France. As a fitting tribute at Diana's funeral Sir Elton John sang Goodbye England's Rose, a reworking of the tune Candle In the Wind, which he had written earlier about Marilyn Monroe.
Convicted domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building. The former U.S. soldier and Gulf War veteran had turned anti-government in response to the controversial ATF raids at Waco, Texas and Ruby Ridge.
Scottish scientists announced that they had successfully cloned the first mammal, a sheep named Dolly, igniting a global debate over the advancement of cell research and the moral dilemmas of creating ""artificial"" life.
In the American League...
The Cleveland Indians put on a power-hitting clinic in Milwaukee, blasting a franchise-record eight home runs en route to a commanding 11-4 victory over the Brewers. Matt Williams led the charge with three long balls, David Justice chipped in two, and Sandy Alomar, Manny Ramirez, and Chad Curtis each went yard. But the Brewers weren’t about to go quietly—their own trio of sluggers, Dave Nilsson, Jeromy Burnitz, and John Jaha, launched three of their own, tying a Major League record for combined home runs in a regulation game. It was a night of historic fireworks, with baseballs leaving the yard at a dizzying pace!
The Toronto Blue Jays hosted the Montreal Expos in an ""all Canadian affair"", as part of the new inter-league schedule, marking the first time since World War II that the U.S. National Anthem was not heard before a Major League ball game.
New York Yankee David Wells took the mound against the Cleveland Indians apparently wearing a hat that belonged to the late Babe Ruth. The eccentric pitcher was reported as paying $35,000 for the Bambino's cap and wore the heirloom for — an inning in which he surrendered no hits. After manager Joe Torre ordered him to remove the hat, in compliance with Major League uniform regulations, the lefthander was shelled for eight hits and four runs en route to 12-8 loss.
In the National League...
Deion Sanders, of the Cincinnati Reds; was reprimanded by National League Vice President Katy Feeney for altering his uniform as a tribute to Jackie Robinson. Sanders wore his pants at knee length and trimmed the sleeves off of his jersey after seeing a photograph of the late Brooklyn Dodger on a Wheaties box. The following day his teammates mimicked his alterations circumventing the league official's decree by promoting team uniformity.
The Colorado Rockies' Andres Galarraga launched a 529-foot grand slam off of the Florida Marlins' Kevin Brown for what is considered to be one of the longest homeruns ever; second only to Mickey Mantle's 565-foot tape-measure blast.
The Florida Marlins became the first expansion team to win the World Series after only five years of existence. Although the victory was over the American League powerhouse Cleveland Indians, most fans did not grant the Marlins the respect they deserved citing the team's $89 million dollar payroll as the determining factor. The accusations eventually proved true as the financially strapped owners were forced to dismantle the majority of the franchise in the post-season expansion draft.
Around the League...
In the 50th anniversary year of Jackie Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, a special commemorative baseball was issued to every team for use in their opener. Throughout the season many tributes were held to honor Robinson who's number 42 was permanently retired by all Major League teams.
Curt Flood, the player whose lawsuit changed the business of baseball forever and resulted in free agency, died of cancer on January 20th. Earlier in the year, Congressman John Conyers paid tribute to the former Red, Cardinal and Senator by using his number 21 on the proposed bill that was intended to remove baseball's antitrust exemption.
The novel concept of inter-league play proved a success as attendance for those games went up 35 percent with records set in Chicago, New York and Seattle. Cumulatively, the 84 American vs. National League match-ups attracted almost three million fans with the A.L. winning forty-eight games and the N.L. topping thirty-six.
Ila Borders became the first female pitcher in history to start a Minor League baseball game as the Duluth-Superior Dukes challenged the Sioux Falls Canaries in the Northern League. Borders was credited with two strikeouts while surrendering five hits, three runs and two walks in the 8-3 loss.
""You are challenged by the game of baseball to do your very best, day in and day out, and that's all I've ever tried to do."" - Cal Ripken, Jr.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1998 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
Senator John Glenn blasted off for the second time at age seventy-seven to participate in a study of the effects of weightlessness and space stress on the elderly. The veteran astronaut had no difficulties performing his duties aboard the Space Shuttle and returned to earth with flying colors.
The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, and Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern had a sex scandal dubbed Sexgate by the media. Clinton, 49 years old, and Lewinsky, 22 years old started their sexual relationship in 1995, ended it in 1997, and made national news when coming Clinton made the following infamous statement on January 26, 1998, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.""
Seventy-six million people tuned in to view the last installment of a ""show about nothing"" as Seinfeld broadcasted its farewell performance. The series is still the most widely viewed sitcom ever in syndication and has made creator Jerry Seinfeld one of the wealthiest royalty recipients in the history of television.
In the American League...
The Oakland Athletics Rickey Henderson scored the 2,000th run of his career in the A's 15-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians. In doing so, he joined Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Pete Rose, and Willie Mays as the only players to reach the milestone.
Cal Ripken started his 2,500th consecutive game as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Oakland A's, 8-2. In perspective, the subsequent twenty-two longest active streaks (combined) add up to less than the ""Iron Man's"" own total.
Manager Joe Torre's Yankees outplayed the 1927 team and finished the season with an astonishing one hundred, fourteen regular-season wins and eleven postseason victories. The Bombers win column represented the most ""Ws"" by any team in one hundred, twenty-three years of Major League baseball.
In the National League...
Montreal Expos skipper Felipe Alou tallied his 521st career-win as manager thanks to veteran pitcher Dustin Hermanson who was also the starter in Alou's 400th, 450th, and 500th wins.
On September 8th, St. Louis Cardinal Mark McGwire topped Roger Maris' single-season home run mark by slugging his sixty-second of the year off the Chicago Cubs' Steve Trachsel. Fittingly, Sammy Sosa, McGwire's closest running mate in the race to break sixty-one, was in attendance on the field.
San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds hit his 400th home run, off the Florida Marlins' Kirt Ojala and became the first player in Major League history to boast four-hundred homeruns and four-hundred steals in a career.
Around the League...
Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray died at the age of eighty-four, four days after collapsing at a Valentine's Day dinner. The Wrigley Field icon, known best for leading the fans in the traditional rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" left behind countless memories from a career that spanned half a century.
In an effort to secure financial stability, the Cleveland Indians requested permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell four million shares of the team to the public.
Congress finally passed a bill that removed part of baseball's seventy-six year antitrust exemption. The groundbreaking citation was supported by both the owners and the players union and was later signed by President Bill Clinton.
In November, Yankee and A's icon Jim ""Catfish"" Hunter was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an ultimately fatal neurological condition better known as ""Lou Gehrig's disease.""
""You measure the value of a ballplayer by how many fannies he puts in the seats."" - George Steinbrenner

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1999 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
President Bill Clinton was acquitted of impeachment charges and remained in office despite originally denying that he had improper relations with a White House intern. After a thorough investigation it was later discovered that the President had lied under oath and he eventually confessed and apologized to the American people.
The disturbing trend of violence in American schools reached an all-time high as two students entered Columbine High School with an arsenal of weapons and explosives killing thirteen of their classmates before taking their own lives.
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister in-law were killed as their plane, piloted by JFK Jr., crashed en route to a Kennedy cousin's wedding ceremony.
In the American League...
In a surprise move, the New York Yankees traded pitcher David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays for five-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens. Both are later reunited in pinstripes on the same Yankee rotation.
Texas Ranger Ivan ""Pudge"" Rodriguez tied the highest batting average for a catcher since Bill Dickey batted .332 in 1937. He also added thirty-five home runs, twenty-five stolen bases and one-hundred thirteen runs batted in to his cumulative stats.
The Baltimore Orioles traveled to Havana Cuba to play the national team in an exhibition game witnessed by the attending Fidel Castro. The Blackbirds defeated the Cubans 3-2 in an eleven inning affair. Two months later, the tables were turned though as the national team traveled to Camden Yards and crushed the home team 12-6 in the first game ever played between the two countries on American soil.
In the National League...
""The Big Unit"", Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks, continued to dominate on the hill winning the National League Cy Young with a 17-9 record, 2.48 ERA, twelve complete games and an astonishing three-hundred sixty-four strike outs.
On April 23rd, St. Louis Cardinal Fernando Tatis set a Major League record as the only player ever to hit two grand slams in a single inning as well as the only player ever to drive-in eight runs during a single frame. Both slams are off of the Los Angeles Dodgers' Chan Ho Park who had certainly seen better days on the mound.
Another Cardinal, Mark McGwire continued to set a new standard at the plate by following up his record-breaking seventy-home run season with sixty-five more. The St. Louis slugger now held the #1 and #2 spots for single-season performances and belted his 500th career homer only a year after slamming number four-hundred.
Around the League...
Commissioner Bud Selig announced baseball's newest annual award created for the leading hitter in each respective league. Named after Hank Aaron, the citation recognizes the leader in hits, home runs and runs batted in.
The Associated Press reported that the average salary for a Major League ball player had grown to an astonishing $1.7 million dollars a year. The New York Times later printed that the average salary for a New York Yankee was $3 million much to the dismay of the rest of the league.
Baseball announced its twenty-five man All-Century Team as selected by fan balloting. The line-up included: Lou Gehrig (1B), Jackie Robinson (2B), Cal Ripken Jr. (SS), Mike Schmidt (3B), Babe Ruth (OF), Hank Aaron (OF), Ted Williams (OF), Johnny Bench (C), Nolan Ryan (RHP) and Sandy Koufax (LHP).
Baseball and the world bid farewell to Joe DiMaggio who passed away on May 8th. During his fabled thirteen-year career, ""The Yankee Clipper"" captured three Most Valuable Player trophies and became one of the most revered players ever to lace up a pair of cleats.

In 1999, Pedro Martinez won the Cy Young Award, but did you know he also accomplished the unusually rare feat of a Triple Crown?
Only a handful of American League pitchers have ever struck out four batters during a single inning. On May 12, 1999, Chuck Finley of Anaheim joined that elite group. Three months later, on August 15, 1999, Chuck Finley became the first pitcher to do it twice!
On May 10, 1999, Nomar Garciaparra became one of the few hitters to ever hit two grand slams during one game!

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2000 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
""Y2K"" spawned a paranoid phenomenon due to the impending threat of the world's computers crashing. Despite millions of dollars and countless man-hours spent in preparation, the impending cyber-disaster amounted to nothing.
The U.S. presidential race between Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democratic hopeful Al Gore ended amid controversy. The world watched as the most powerful nation on earth used the courts to sort out what was the most evenly divided recent presidential election of the United States.
After years of delays, the International Space Station was finally operating in orbit thanks to a combined effort of technological resources from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Russia, eleven nations of the European Space Agency and Brazil.
In the American League...
Shortstop sensation Nomar Garciaparra earned his second consecutive batting title and Pedro Martinez earned his third Cy Young Award in four years, but it wasn't enough to get the Red Sox to the playoffs for a third consecutive season. Despite their best efforts, ""The Curse of the Bambino"" continued to reign as the Sox finished 2½ games behind the Yankees in the American League East.
The Detroit Tigers topped the Minnesota Twins, 12-11 on October 1st, as Shane Halter became the fourth Major Leaguer in history to play all nine positions in a game. Both teams combined to use fifteen pitchers, tying the Major League mark and setting an American League record.
The Cleveland Indians became the leagues fifth, triple play victim at the hands of the Baltimore Orioles during a September 1st outing. With runners at first and second and no outs, shortstop Melvin Mora intentionally dropped Sandy Alomar's pop fly, then threw to Jerry Hairston who tagged the runner at second as well as the runner coming from first. A confused Alomar retreated to the dugout believing the infield fly rule is in effect and was called out for leaving the basepath.
In the National League...
Major league baseball ordered Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker to undergo psychological testing following racial remarks he had made during an off-season interview with Sports Illustrated. He was later suspended for fourteen days and allowed to attend Spring Training after paying an undisclosed fine and attending sensitivity training.
The Chicago Cubs christened the 2000 season by defeating the New York Mets, 5-3 in the Tokyo Dome in Japan marking the first Major League game ever played on Asian soil.
Following the death of Montreal Canadian Maurice Richard, the Expos announced that they would wear ""The Rocket's"" number nine for the remainder of the season as a tribute to the late hockey icon. It was the first time that a Major League Baseball team was believed to have honored an athlete from another sport.
Around the League...
American League president Gene Budig resigned and was appointed a senior adviser to baseball commissioner Bud Selig. The American and National leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities with all rights and functions consolidated in the commissioner's office.
Following a May 16th incident in which sixteen Los Angeles Dodger players and three coaches entered the stands during a fight with fans at Wrigley Field, nineteen suspensions are handed out resulting in the loss of sixty games for the players and twenty-four for the coaches.
Andrew Klein, a boy who was struck in the head and suffered permanent brain damage while attending batting practice before a Florida Marlins game in 1997, was finally awarded $1.05 million by a state court jury. The decision set the stage for limiting children's access to players on the field and required stricter safety guidelines for kid's pre-game ballpark programs.
Four American League teams finished with a better winning percentage than the New York Yankees. However, the Bronx Bombers were really not concerned with the final standings and progressed through the post-season with ease defeating their cross-town rival Mets four games to one in the fourteenth rendition of the ""Subway Series"".
""It was basically an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and in the NFL you get fifteen yards for that. They found there was no intent (during the bat throwing incident in the 2000 World Series) and we knew it was that way from the beginning."" - Roger Clemens

Pedro Martinez of Boston was the ERA champion in 1999 as well, but did you know that during the 2000 season his nearest competition was Roger Clemens of New York who finished the season with a 3.70 ERA?
On April 23, 2000, Bernie Williams of New York hit two home runs - one from each side of the plate. Jorge Posada matched the feat with his second homer in the ninth inning and they became the first duo to perform the feat during the same game!
In Major League history, no player had won the All-Star Most Valuable Player Award and World Series Most Valuable Player Award during the same season until Derek Jeter won each during this season!

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2011 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
A 9.1-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit the east of Japan on March 11, killing 15,840 and leaving another 3,926 missing. Tsunami warnings were issued in 50 countries and territories. Emergencies were declared at four nuclear power plants affected by the quake.
On April 29th an estimated two billion people watched the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey in London.
The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, the most elaborate Martian exploration vehicle to date, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center on November 26th. It was scheduled to land on Mars on August 5, 2012, and it successfully landed there on August 6th, 2012.
In the American League...
At U.S. Cellular Field, May 3rd, Francisco Liriano of the Minnesota Twins pitched the first no-hitter of the season over the Chicago White Sox. Despite walking six batters, he was helped out by three double plays. A fourth-inning home run by Jason Kubel off Edwin Jackson (himself a no-hit pitcher on June 25, 2010) accounted for the game's only run. The game was Liriano's first complete game in 95 Major League starts and the first no-hitter by a Twin since Eric Milton in 1999.
Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees became the 28th member of the 3,000 hit club, homering off David Price in the third inning of the Yankees' 5-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on July 9th. Jeter became the first player to reach the milestone exclusively as a Yankee, and only the second to do so with a home run, joining Wade Boggs in 1999.
Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers wons his 20th game of the season on August 27th. He was the first Tigers 20-game winner since Bill Gullickson in 1991, and it marked the 44th time in Tigers history that a pitcher had reached 20 wins in a season.
In the National League...
The New York Mets agreed to sell a minority, non-operating investment in the team to David Einhorn, president of Greenlight Capital Inc., for $200 million, pending the completion of exclusive negotiations and approval by Major League Baseball owners. The deal gave him a one-third stake in the team and he has an option to own sixty percent in three years.
Two days of baseball? July 26–27, the Atlanta Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates played a nineteen inning marathon (the longest game in either franchise's history) that ended in the early morning hours.
The New York Mets won 10-9 win over the Cincinnati Reds to complete a four game sweep at Great American Ballpark on July 28th. It was the first sweep of a four game series against the Reds in their entire history.
Around the League...
The defense in the Barry Bonds perjury case rested without calling a single witness to the stand on April 6th. After prosecutors dropped one of the five charges against Bonds, and called 25 witnesses to the stand over 2½ weeks, the defense takes just one minute to present its side. Prosecutors drop the count accusing Bonds of lying to a grand jury in 2003 when he says prior to that season he never takes anything other than vitamins from trainer Greg Anderson. One week later, the jury deciding the federal case against Barry Bonds found him guilty of obstruction of justice. The jury was hung on the three counts of making false declarations during his 2003 testimony before the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) grand jury, resulting in a mistrial.
Commissioner Bud Selig announced that Major League Baseball takes over operations of the Los Angeles Dodgers from owner Frank McCourt. The press release stated, ""Pursuant to my authority as Commissioner, I informed Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt today that I will appoint a representative to oversee all aspects of the business and the day to day operations of the club. I have taken this action because of my deep concerns regarding the finances and operations of the Dodgers and to protect the best interests of the club, its great fans and all of Major League Baseball. My office will continue its thorough investigation into the operations and finances of the Dodgers and related entities during the period of Mr. McCourt's ownership. I will announce the name of my representative in the next several days. The Dodgers have been one of the most prestigious franchises in all of sports, and we owe it to their legion of loyal fans to ensure that this club is being operated properly now and will be guided appropriately in the future.""
World Baseball Classic Inc. announced the introduction of a play-in round for the 2013 World Baseball Classic that allowed twelve new countries to compete for the first time. The new round brings in sixteen teams divided into four pools, and the winner of each pool would advance to play in the World Baseball Classic. Canada, Chinese Taipei, Panama and South Africa compete in the play-in round after not winning a game in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. New participants include France, Spain, Great Britain, Germany, New Zealand, Colombia, Nicaragua, Brazil, Israel, Thailand, the Czech Republic and the Philippines.

Did you know that Mariano Rivera became the first pitcher in Major League Baseball history to make 1,000 appearances with one team, reaching the milestone on May 25, 2011? Rivera also becomes the 15th pitcher in MLB history with 1,000 career appearances.
The Los Angeles Angels' Ervin Santana no-hit the Cleveland Indians on July 27, 2011. Despite not giving up a hit, his team was down 1-0 until a fifth inning sacrifice fly by Mike Trout, as Ezequiel Carrera reached base on an error by shortstop Erick Aybar in the first, proceeded to steal second, reached third on Asdrubal Cabrera's ground out, then scored on a wild pitch. The Angels won by a final score of 3-1.
On August 15, 2011, Jim Thome hit two home runs in the Minnesota Twins' 9-6 victory over the Detroit Tigers, the second of which made Thome the eighth player with 600 career home runs.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2012 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
After two-hundred forty-four years since its first publication, the Encyclopædia Britannica discontinues its print edition.
On October 14th, Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner becomes the first person to break the sound barrier without any machine assistance during a record space dive out of the Red Bull Stratos helium-filled balloon from 24 miles (39 kilometers) over Roswell, New Mexico in the United States.
The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events would occur around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,125-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. Luckily for baseball fans (and people worldwide), the apocalypse did not occur.
In the American League...
Fenway Park celebrated its 100th birthday, with about 200 former Boston Red Sox players, managers and coaches coming out for the pre-game introduction. The New York Yankees, however, spoiled the party and defeated the Red Sox 6-2 on five home runs, all off starter Clay Buchholz.
A record-tying six Seattle Mariner pitchers combined to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kevin Millwood threw the first six innings before leaving the game with a groin injury; he was relieved by Charlie Furbush, Stephen Pryor (who recorded his first major league victory), Lucas Luetge and Brandon League, before Tom Wilhelmsen closed out a 1–0 win and was credited with the save. The six pitchers tied a record for most in a combined no-hitter, which was set by six Houston Astros pitchers who no-hit the New York Yankees during the 2003 season.
Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers finished the season winning the American League Triple Crown, leading the league with 44 home runs, 139 runs batted in, and a .330 batting average. Cabrera became the first Triple Crown winner since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.
In the National League...
The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the renamed Miami Marlins 4-1 in the first regular-season game at Marlins Park. The ceremonial first pitch is thrown by Muhammad Ali, who won his first of three heavyweight boxing championships by defeating Sonny Liston in Miami in 1964.
After 50 seasons and 8,020 games, the New York Mets recorded their first no-hitter as Johan Santana performed the deed in the Mets' 8-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals at Citi Field. Santana was assisted in the sixth inning by a foul ball call on a Carlos Beltran line drive over third base that appeared to land on the chalk line (Beltran eventually grounds out to third baseman David Wright) and by Mike Baxter's seventh-inning catch to rob Yadier Molina of a possible extra-base hit. The no-hitter left the San Diego Padres, who began play in 1969, as the only remaining team without a no-hitter.
The Washington Nationals defeated the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers, 4–1 on September 20th, they secured at least a National League wild card place and brought playoff baseball back to the U.S. capital for the first time in 79 years, when the Washington Senators fell to the New York Giants in the 1933 World Series.
Around the League...
New York Mets COO Jeff Wilpon, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and owner Fred Wilpon announced that the 2013 All-Star Game will be held at Citi Field.
The National League shutout the American League, 8–0, in the 83rd All-Star Game played in Kansas City's Kaufmann Stadium. NL starting pitcher Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants threw two shutout innings for the win, while teammates Pablo Sandoval and Melky Cabrera and Milwaukee Brewers' Ryan Braun contributed most of the offensive firepower. Sandoval hit a bases-loaded triple and scored one run during a five-run first inning off Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander, while Braun doubled, tripled and made a fine catch in the outfield. Cabrera belted a two-run home run and scored two times to take home the MVP Award. Atlanta Braves' Chipper Jones singled in his final All-Star at-bat, at age 40.
Major League Baseball expanded its playoff format to ten teams for the 2012 season, adding a second wild card in each league. The decision established a new one-game, wild-card round in each league between the teams with the best records.
""It is unfortunate, but we played as hard as we could. Losing to the World Series champions isn't too bad. We played good baseball, but they just beat us. We had a great season to get to the playoffs, and we played well to get to the World Series. You just don't get to write your own script."" - Fielder, Prince. Detroit Tigers Lose World Series Game 4 As Miguel Cabrera Home Run Isn't Not Enough. The Huffington Post. 29 October 2012.

2012 American League Final Standings
On April 21, 2012, Philip Humber pitched the first perfect game in the majors in almost two years, leading the Chicago White Sox to a 4–0 victory over the Seattle Mariners. It was the 21st perfect game in Major League history and the first since Philadelphia Phillies ace Roy Halladay threw one against the Florida Marlins on May 29, 2010.
Did you know that Ryan Cook of the Oakland Athletics became the sixtieth pitcher in Major League history to strike out four batters in an inning on April 27, 2012? J. J. Hardy, Nick Markakis, Adam Jones, and Matt Wieters of the Baltimore Orioles each struck out swinging in the bottom of the eighth inning, with Jones reaching first base as the result of a third-strike wild pitch.
Josh Hamilton tied the Major League record by hitting four home runs, all of them two-run shots, as he went five-for-five in the Texas Rangers' 10–3 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards on May 8th. It marked the 16th four-home-run game in major league history, and the 6th in the American League.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2014 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
An outbreak of Ebola started in West Africa and began to spread rapidly in 2014, mainly across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The global health crisis took the lives of 6,000+ people, infected more than 17,000, and made the World a much smaller place.
On March 8, 2014, a script from a Hollywood television series actually occurred when a Malaysian Airline flight from Kuala Lumpur simply vanished, leaving no evidence of it's existence, no crash site to investigate and no trace of 239 passengers who were on board the still not found airliner.
In the American League...
The Kansas City Royals chose not to listen to pre-season predictions, book making experts, and statistical experts - who had proven their WAR was not on par with the Orioles, the Angels, the Tigers, and hardly even in the same league with everyone else, which made for a great Cinderella story throughout the year and deep into the playoffs. Though they lost the World Series 3-4 to the war-proven Giants, they left all the underdog rooting traditional fans with a great war story...
The Cleveland Indians broke the record set by the 2013 Detroit Tigers for strikeouts in a season by a pitching staff when Corey Kluber struck out David DeJesus in the eighth inning of a game on September 26, 2014. It was the Indians 1,429th strikeout of the season, breaking the tie with the Tigers, and they finished the year with 1,450.
The Oakland Athletics started the 2014 season setting a new (not so desirable) Major League record when the lost their tenth straight home opener, this time courtesy of the Cleveland Indians.
In the National League...
The Chicago Cub - playing in their 100th season in Wrigley Field - lost to the Atlanta Braves on May 11, 2014, their 10,000 loss in franchise history joining two other senior circuit teams in the ""10,000 Games Lost Club"", the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves.
The New York Mets were one of several National League teams in 2014 to wear patriotic / military themed jerseys, throwback jerseys, and commemorative patches (one for Ralph Kiner and one for Frank Cashen), but they added their mascot, Mr. Met, to their alternate home jersey (blue) and road jerseys.
The San Francisco Giants like even numbered years as they won their third World Championship in the previous five years, adding World Series titles to their truly historic franchise for 2010, 2012 and 2014.
Around the League...
The 2014 Major League Baseball season began on March 22, 2014, in Sydney, Australia, between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks. It was the first time in baseball history where the season opener was played in that particular continent.
The 2014 season was the final for it's reigning Commissioner of Baseball, Bud Selig, who had been steering the ship since 1992. From 1992 through 1998, Selig was the acting commissioner, and in 1998 he was (finally) appointed the official Commissioner of Baseball.
The 2014 season featured an expanded video review process that allowed managers to challenge certain plays no more than twice per game, including force plays, fair or foul balls, and batters hit by a pitch. If the manager exhausted his ability to challenge a play the Crew Chief could, after the completion of the sixth inning, choose to invoke instant reply themselves.
""The '90s were difficult. We had a lot of headaches. We lost the 1994 World Series. That was a sad thing. … But history has proven that set up the next 21 years of labor peace. I can say the sport has never been more popular. In the last 10 years, we have had the most attendance ever. We have a labor peace that was unheard of. When I took over, the game's revenues were $1.7 billion. They are now $8.5 billion. People refer to the post-war era as the Golden Age of Baseball. Any way you look at it, this is the Golden Age of Baseball."" - Selig, Bud. Commissioner of Baseball. Selig having fun in his farewell tour of ballparks. Ringolsby, Tracy. MLB Staff Writer. 2 May 2014.

The Texas Rangers took a risk when they signed Yu Darvish and in 2014, he recorded his 500th career strikeout, reaching the plateau on April 6, in 401.2 innings - a new Major League record (previously held by Kerry Wood, 404.2).
Did you know that the New York Yankees were the first franchise to amass 15,000 home runs? Brett Gardner hit the record setting home run on September 21, 2014.
The American League Rookie of the Year went to Jose Abreu who set a new rookie record for home runs in April (10), breaking the mark (8) set by Kent Hrbek which was tied by Carlos Delgado and Albert Pujols. Abreu, during that same month, drove in 32 runs, breaking the mark of 27 set by Albert Pujols.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2015 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The College Football Playoff National Championship was played for the first time in college football history. A bracket tournament between the top four teams was established before the season and on January 12, 2015, the Ohio State Buckeyes (#4) defeated the Oregon Ducks (#2) in AT&T Stadium 42-20.
In the American League...
The Houston Astros will wear a commemorative patch in 2015 on their jerseys to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their team name (specifically, the Astros, not including their first name, the Colt .45s).
New skippers at the helm in 2015 for the Texas Rangers, the Minnesota Twins, the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Houston Astros. The Rangers Ron Washington and the Rays Joe Maddon retired while the Twins (Ron Gardenhire) and Astros (Bo Porter) fired their previous managers.
The Minnesota Twins made the only significant uniform change in 2015, removing the pinstripes from their home jerseys and adding gold trim both the Twins name on their jerseys and the Twin Cities logo on their caps.
In the National League...
The St. Louis Cardinals will visit the Chicago Cubs to kick off the 2015 season at the newly refurbished Wrigley Field.
The Washington Nationals, now celebrating their tenth season in the National League, will wear a commemorative patch in 2015 on their jerseys. The Cubs uniform will also include a patch, but theirs will be worn in honor of the late, great, Mr. Cub (Ernie Banks), who passed away on January 23, 2015.
New skippers at the helm in 2015 for two National League teams, the Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs. Both teams firing their managers in 2014, Kirk Gibson and Rick Renteria respectively, and starting the season with new men at the helm in 2015, Chip Hale and Joe Maddon respectively.
Around the League...
The newly appointed Commissioner of Baseball, Rob Manfred will be at the helm in 2015, his first regular season as Commissioner of Baseball, succeeding Bud Selig.
The Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, Ohio, home of the National League Cincinnati Reds, will be hosting the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, scheduled for Tuesday, July 14, 2015.
Interleague play remains and each team is scheduled to play 20 interleague games. The matchups for the season will be the AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central and AL West vs NL West.
""Another priority for me is to continue to modernize the game (in 2015) without interfering with its history and traditions. Last season's expanded instant replay improved the game's quality and addressed concerns shared by fans and players. We made a dramatic change without altering the game's fundamentals. I look forward to tapping into the power of technology to consider additional advancements that will continue to heighten the excitement of the game, improve the pace of play and attract more young people to the game"" - Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred (01/25/2015, 'Commissioner Rob Manfred's letter to fans', Source)

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2016 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the European Union, a politico-economic union of twenty-eight member states that are located primarily in Europe.
The 2016 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad and commonly known as Rio 2016, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 5th through August 21st, 2016.
News in the United States was virtually dominated by clashes between the two presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
In the American League...
New York Yankees rookie sensation Gary Sanchez became; the fastest player in Major League history to reach 11 home runs, doing so in his 23rd career game on August 27, 2016, against the Baltimore Orioles, the first rookie in Major League history to win consecutive Player of the Week awards, and when he hit his 19th home run on September 21, 2016, against the Tampa Bay Rays, he became the quickest player in Major League history to hit 19 home runs, doing so in his 45th game.
On August 19, 2016, the Baltimore Orioles set a new Major League record by hitting four home runs before recording their first out, in the course of a five run first inning against the Houston Astros.
The Cleveland Indians defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2016 ALCS despite hitting just .168, setting a Major League record for the lowest batting average for a winning team in a postseason series. When they defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0 in Game 3 of the 2016 World Series, it was their fifth shutout of the postseason, also a Major League record!
In the National League...
The 2016 San Diego Padres became the first team in Major League history to be shut out in three consecutive games to open a season. San Diego lost to Los Angeles by the scores of 15–0 (the largest shutout victory on Opening Day in Major League history.), 3–0 and 7–0, respectively.
Jake Arrieta (Chicago Cubs) threw his second career no-hitter, destroying the Cincinnati Reds 16–0 on April 21, 2016. Arrieta walked four and struck out six as he became the fourth reigning Cy Young winner (joining Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, and Clayton Kershaw), to throw a no-hitter the following season.
The Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins played a special neutral-site game at Fort Bragg Stadium, on July 3, 2016, a newly constructed field in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in observance of the Independence Day long weekend. It was the first professional, regular-season sporting event held on an active military installation.
Around the League...
The Major League Baseball All-Star Game's 87th edition was played on July 12, 2016, at Petco Park in San Diego, California, home of the San Diego Padres. The American League, who won the All-Star Game 4–2, also won home-field advantage in the 2016 World Series.
New to the rule book in 2016, Rule 6.01(j), which created criteria for a legal slide while trying to break up a double play, which is defined as making contact with the ground before reaching the base, being able to and attempting to reach the base with a hand or foot, being able to and attempting to remain on the base at the completion of the slide (except at home plate) and not changing his path for the purpose of initiating contact with a fielder.
""It might as well be a matchup from a movie: the two teams with the longest title droughts in baseball paired in the same World Series. No wonder, then, that Joe Maddon has watched Field of Dreams since his Chicago Cubs clinched the National League pennant. 'I cry easily,' said Maddon, the Cubs’ manager. 'So the connection to the past is very important.' To loosely quote the script, the memories could be so thick at this World Series, the fans will have to swat them away from their faces. The Cubs have gone 108 years without a championship. The Cleveland Indians have gone 68. No other team in baseball has come close to so many consecutive unfulfilled seasons. 'The baseball gods are really happy right now,' the Indians' Mike Napoli said. 'I wanted the Cubs to win, just because I knew how cool it would be to be a part of it. I think it's going to be a special World Series. There's two droughts, and there’s going to be a winner.'"" - New York Times Staff Writer Tyler Kepner (10/24/2016, World Series Preview: For Cubs or Indians, Decades of Waiting Are Nearly Over, Source)

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2017 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
News in the United States - and around many parts of the World - included the ongoing support, and non-support, for the President of the United States, Donald Trump. Though Baseball Almanac did not officially measure this statistic, we believe that either Trump, or his tweets, made the headlines, every single day of the year.
North Korea spent most of the year making international headlines with their nuclear missile tests. On February 3rd they fired a ballistic missile across the Sea of Japan, prompting world talks that continued throughout the year. By September 3rd, they had conducted their sixth, and most powerful, nuclear test.

On August 20, the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals played a game at the minor league BB&T Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The game coincided with the Little League World Series, held annually in nearby South Williamsport, and was exclusively attended by Little League players and their families.
Around the League...
In March 2017, the following Major League Baseball rule changes went into affect, after being ratified by the Major League Baseball Players Association:
The start of a no-pitch intentional walk, allowing the defensive team's manager to signal a decision to the home plate umpire to intentionally walk the batter. Following the signal of the manager's intention, the umpire will immediately award first base to the batter.
A 30-second limit for a manager to decide whether to challenge a play and invoke replay review.
When a manager has exhausted his challenges for the game, Crew Chiefs may now invoke replay review for non-home run calls beginning in the eighth inning instead of the seventh inning.
A conditional two-minute guideline for Replay Officials to render a decision on replay review, allowing various exceptions.
A prohibition on the use of any markers on the field that could create a tangible reference system for fielders.
An addition to Rule 5.07 formalizes an umpire interpretation by stipulating that a pitcher may not take a second step toward home plate with either foot or otherwise reset his pivot foot in his delivery of the pitch. If there is at least one runner on base, then such an action will be called as a balk under Rule 6.02(a). If the bases are unoccupied, then it will be considered an illegal pitch under Rule 6.02(b).
An amendment to Rule 5.03 requires base coaches to position themselves behind the line of the coach's box closest to home plate and the front line that runs parallel to the foul line prior to each pitch. Once a ball is put in play, a base coach is allowed to leave the coach's box to signal a player so long as the coach does not interfere with the play.
The 88th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played on July 11, 2017, at Marlins Park, the home of the Miami Marlins. For the first time since 2002, when the game ended in a tie, the All Star Game would not determine home field advantage for the World Series. Instead, home field advantage will be awarded to the team with the better regular season record.
As a consequence of Hurricane Harvey damaging the Houston area, the interleague match-up between the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros from August 29–31, was moved from Minute Maid Park to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. Although the Astros were the designated home team, they wore their away uniforms during the three-game Lone Star Series, while the Rangers wore their home uniforms.
""'Twenty years ago, when you talked to National League owners about the DH, you'd think you were talking some sort of heretical comment,' Manfred told reporters Thursday at the owners meetings in Coral Gables, Fla. 'But we have a newer group. There's been turnover. And I think our owners in general have demonstrated a willingness to change the game in ways that we think would be good for the fans, always respecting the history and traditions of the sport.'"" - Botte, Peter. New York Daily News Staff Writer. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred says National League could implement DH by 2017. 21 January 2016.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2018 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The year started with some history making news in the National Football League as the Philadelphia Eagles won their first Super Bowl in franchise history, defeating the heavily favored (yet again) New England Patriots, 41-33, in Super Bowl LII, ending a 57-year championship drought.
In the American League...
The Detroit Tigers modified the Olde English D on their home jersey to match the D on the cap. This was the first major change to the Tigers' home jersey since 1934.
A ""feel good"" story of the year surrounded the return of Atlanta Braves pitcher Jonny Venters. The Tampa Bay Rays stuck with the determined lefty who had Tommy John surgery three times and successfully returned to the mound on April 25, 2018 - the first pitcher to make it back to the majors after three such operations.
In the National League...
The 89th Major League Baseball All-Star Game will be held on July 17, 2018, at Nationals Park, the home of the Washington Nationals.
The National League & American League had a combined 7,335 strikeouts and 6,992 hits during the month of April. Never in Major League history had their been a month with more strikeouts than hits, until 2018!
Around the League...
All thirty Major League Baseball teams were scheduled to play an Opening Day game on March 29, 2018, the earliest start of a regular season in baseball history.
Major League Baseball implemented new pace of play rules in 2018, which include limiting the amount of mound visits for each team to six visits per nine innings. Teams will receive an additional visit for every extra inning played.
Under the new collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, the 2018 regular season was extended to 187 days in order to add four additional off-days for all teams.
""Twenty years ago, when you talked to National League owners about the DH, you'd think you were talking some sort of heretical comment,"" Manfred told reporters Thursday at the owners meetings in Coral Gables, Fla. ""But we have a newer group. There's been turnover. And I think our owners in general have demonstrated a willingness to change the game in ways that we think would be good for the fans, always respecting the history and traditions of the sport."" - New York Daily News Staff Peter Botte (01/21/2016, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred says National League could implement DH by 2017, Source)

Off the field...
The 2019 Major League Baseball season began on March 20, 2019, and is the 150th anniversary of professional baseball, dating back to the 1869 foundation of the Cincinnati Reds.
Four rule changes went into effect in 2019. The time between innings was reduced from 2:05 to 2:00 in local games, and 2:25 to 2:00 in nationally televised games. The August trade deadline was cancelled, leaving just one trade deadline in Major League Baseball, July 31, 2019. The last two were related to the Midsummer Classic, the first is a two-round voting method for fans to select All-Stars, the second will award the winner of the Home Run Derby a $1,000,000 bonus!
In the American League...
The Cleveland Indians agreed to stop using their ""Chief Wahoo"" logo on January 29, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the team unveiled new uniforms excluding the Chief Wahoo logo, as well as new hats with red brims for home games, a new red-colored home alternate jersey (marking the team's first red jersey since the 1970s), and sleeve patches commemorating their hosting of the 2019 All-Star Game.
The regular season began on March 20, 2019, when the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners played a two-game series in Tokyo, Japan, at the Tokyo Dome.
A London Series was played on June 29-30, 2019, when the Boston Red Sox faced-off against the New York Yankees at London Stadium in London, England, on June 29 and 30 making it the first ever regular season series in London under a two-year commitment.
In the National League...
Derek Jeter, CEO of the Miami Marlins, unveiled a new logo, team colors, and uniform on November 16, 2018, for the 2019 season. The new design replaced the one used after the team moved to Marlins Park in 2012, and switched from the Florida Marlins to the Miami Marlins.
The Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs played a game on August 18, 2019, coinciding with the Little League World Series. The MLB Little League Classic was played at BB&T Ballpark, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, for the third straight year.
Around the League...
Opening Day for all teams took place on March 28, 2019, the earliest Opening Day in baseball history when you exclude international season openers. The previous earliest Opening Day was on March 29, 2018.
The second annual Mexico Series of regular season games featured four matchups in 2019. The first match-up was the National League St. Louis Cardinals versus the Cincinnati Reds. The two-game series was played at Monterrey, Mexico's Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey, on April 13 and 14, 2019. The second two-game series, also in Monterrey, featured the American League Houston Astros versus the Los Angeles Angels on May 4 and 5, 2019.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2020 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The 2020 Major League Baseball regular season began on July 23, 2020, and came to a conclusion on September 27, 2020. Shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic each team played sixty regular season games.
On March 26, 2020, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached an agreement on multiple considerations related to the start of the season being delayed, including pro-rated player salaries, based on the 60-game format, however, players did receive full service time for the shortened season.
For 2020, Team Marketing Report calculated five billion dollars in game day losses for Major League Baseball as a result of not having fans in any ballparks for any regular season games.
In the American League...
On July 18, 2020, the Canadian government denied permission for the Toronto Blue Jays to play their home games at Rogers Centre stating that repeated cross-border trips by both the Blue Jays and their opponents would be a major risk due to the higher spikes in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared to those in Canada. The Blue Jays then chose to play their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, home of their Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons
On August 16, 2020, the Chicago White Sox hit four consecutive home runs, tying the Major League record. The history making quartet was Yoan Moncada, Yasmani Grandal, José Abreu and Eloy Jiménez. All four home runs were hit off Roel Ramírez, during his big league debut.
When the Houston Astros made it to the postseason in 2020, Dusty Baker became the first manager in Major League history to lead five different teams to the playoffs!
In the National League...
The designated hitter was used in both the American and National Leagues, not just during interleague games, but in every single game played by every National League team in 2020.
The 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers set the National League record for most home runs in a month by a team after hitting their 57th long ball during August against the Texas Rangers on August 30.
The first team in Major League history to hit at least one grand slam in four consecutive games was the San Diego Padres, who made baseball history on August 17, 18, 19, and 20! All of the record setting grand slams were hit against the Texas Rangers!
Around the League...
On July 23, 2020, MLB and MLBPA announced that the postseason will be an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for 2020 only, instead of the normal 10-team tournament. All first and second place teams in the six divisions will qualify for the playoffs. The final two spots in each league will go to the remaining teams with the best win-loss records. The teams in each league will be seeded by division winners (1–3), division runners-up (4–6), and best teams remaining (7–8). Seeding ties will be resolved by head-to-head record, intra-league record, and record in final 20 intra-league games, to remove the necessity for additional games. The first round of the playoffs will be a best-of-three series called the Wild Card Series, with all games to be played at the home of the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason will follow the usual pattern of five-game Division series, seven-game League Championship Series, and a seven-game World Series.
On July 30, 2020, effective on August 1, all doubleheaders were scheduled as two seven-inning games. One standard doubleheader, which was played on July 28 before the rule change, had already occurred, but due to the number of cancelled games, and doubleheaders needed for each team to reach sixty games played, the length of the doubleheaders was adjusted during the season.
The 91st Major League Baseball All-Star Game was scheduled for July 14, 2020, in Dodger Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers. On July 3, 2020, the All-Star Game was cancelled, and awarded back to the Dodgers in 2022.
""It's pretty cool (winning the 2020 American League batting title). I don't think it's really sank in yet. I wish it was over 162 games, and I wish there were fans in the stands, but it is what it is and I'm definitely proud of it."" - DJ LeMahieu

2020 American League Standings
Did you know that when Mookie Betts had his three-homer game against the San Diego Padres on August 13, 2020, Betts tied the Major League record for most career three-homer games at six (five with the Red Sox / one with the Dodgers)? Mookie joined Sammy Sosa and Johnny Mize as the only other players to accomplish this feat!
On August 25, 2020, Lucas Giolito struck out thirteen hitters and walked one, throwing 74 of his 101 pitches for strikes, and completing the only American League no-hitter of the season.
When Alex Kirilloff made his Major League debut on September 30, 2020, it was during the Wild Card Series. This marks the first time a pitcher has made his debut by starting a postseason game.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2021 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The 2021 Major League Baseball regular season began on April 1, 2021, and ended on October 3, 2021. The World Series (Game 1) was played on October 26. The entire 2021 schedule was released by Major League Baseball on July 9, 2020.
On February 9, 2021, Major League Baseball announced that the following two temporary rule changes from the 2020 season would continue in 2021: Doubleheaders would be played as two seven-inning games, and, a runner will be placed on second base at the start of every half-inning of a game that goes into extra innings.
All thirty Major League Baseball teams celebrated the following special days during the 2021 season; Jackie Robinson Day (April 15, 2021 | #42 Patch), Mother's Day (May 9, 2021 | Pink Ribbons), Father's Day (June 20, 2021 | Blue Ribbons).
In the American League...
The 2021 season was the last where Cleveland's team competed as the Indians, replacing their 106-year-old team name. On December 14, 2020, the franchise announced they would unveil a new moniker, uniform, and stadium changes before the 2022 season.
On August 12, 2021, the MLB at Field of Dreams game, which was originally scheduled for 2020, but cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, featured a matchup between the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox at a purpose-built ballpark in Dyersville, Iowa.
During the Little League World Series, the MLB Little League Classic featured a matchup between the Los Angeles Angels and the Cleveland Indians at BB&T Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania on August 22, 2021.
In the National League...
Miller Park, home of the Milwaukee Brewers, was renamed American Family Field after Madison, Wisconsin-based American Family Insurance outbid the Miller Brewing Company for the ballpark's naming rights renewal contract. Miller's 20-year contract expired at the end of the 2020 season.
The Atlanta Braves celebrated their 150th Anniversary Season in 2021, wearing special patches during the regular season, as well as In Memoriam patches for Hank Aaron and Phil Niekro. In July 2020, the franchise announced they had no plans to change their controversial moniker, telling fans, ""We will always be the Atlanta Braves.""
New York Mets president Sandy Alderson said in a 2021 conference call, ""Having a DH in the National League is a good thing. The fact is, pitchers can’t even bunt anymore. So I'm in favor of putting a hitter in that additional slot. Ultimately it makes the game more exciting. More offense, or more opportunity for offense, a bigger challenge for the pitchers. I just think for the overall quality of the game, the excitement level of the DH is the right thing in the National League.""
Around the League...
The ninety-first All-Star Game was scheduled for July 13, 2021, at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia. On April 2, 2021, Major League Baseball moved the game out of Atlanta, in protest of the passage of a controversial voting law. On April 6, 2021, MLB selected hitter-friendly Coors Field, in Denver, Colorado, as the new host of the Midsummer Classic.
ESPN Radio aired its 24th season of Major League Baseball in 2021, including Sunday Night Baseball Saturday Games, Opening Day games, and the entire postseason.
For the first time in sixty years, the National Baseball Hall of Fame did not induct a new group of electees in 2021. The Class of 2020s induction ceremony was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, so there is a possible event in Cooperstown in 2021.
""I think it's (expanding the postseason) good for baseball because it creates competitiveness. The fans know that if there's eight playoff spots in each league, you're going to have eleven or twelve teams competing for those spots. You know in some form you're going to be in it. So the more things we can do to create competition, I think that helps."" - Boras, Scott. USA Today: MLB rule changes: League still discussing universal DH and expanded playoffs for 2021 season. 15 January 2021.

2021 American League Standings
On April 4, 2021, Akil Baddoo became the thirty-first player in baseball history to hit a home run on the first pitch ever thrown to him during a regular season game. Do you remember who the pitcher was that day? [Answer]
Did you know four no-hitters were thrown in the American League in 2021? Carlos Rodón (April 14, 2021), John Means (May 5, 2021), Spencer Turnbull (May 18, 2021), and Corey Kluber (May 19, 2021).
The 2021 New York Yankees tied the Major League record for most triple plays turned in a season when they turned their third triple play of the season on June 20, 2021. The last team to turn three triple plays in a season was the 2016 Chicago White Sox.

2022 American League Standings
Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association announced via Press Release (excerpts below) SEVERAL rule changes that will be in place during the 2022 baseball season, including:
Designated Hitter: Beginning in 2022, the designated hitter will be in place in both the American and National Leagues. In an effort to afford additional flexibility to starting pitchers who bat for themselves, such players will be considered two separate people for the purposes of Rule 5.11(a). If the player is replaced as a starting pitcher, he can continue as the designated hitter, and if the designated hitter is replaced, he can continue as the starting pitcher.
Extra Innings Rule: In an effort to preserve player health and safety during the condensed schedule, the rule that each extra inning begins with a runner on second base has been restored for the 2022 season.
Active Roster Limits: From Opening Day through May 1st, the 26-player active Major League roster shall increase to 28 (including 29 players for any doubleheaders), and the limitation on the number of pitchers (13) on the active roster and the restriction on position players appearing as pitchers during a game shall not apply. On May 2nd, 26-man rosters, the limit on number of pitchers on the active roster, and the restriction of position players appearing as pitchers will resume.
Replay Announcements: For the first time, Major League umpires will conduct in-park announcements during the replay review process during the 2022 season, enhancing the ballpark and broadcast experiences. Training was conducted in Arizona and Florida this spring.
PitchCom Arrives: Starting in 2022, PitchCom will be available for Major League teams to utilize during games. The communication device will be available for up to five defensive players to use at a given time (including the pitcher and catcher). The catcher uses a transmitter to send signs to the pitcher, who wears a receiver in the band of his cap. Transmissions are encrypted, and Clubs are free to customize the audio as well as the configuration of the transmitter. The new form of communication was tested throughout Spring Training and received a significant amount of positive feedback from players.
The 2022 regular season features 31 scheduled doubleheaders, including 26 split doubleheaders and five of the traditional variety. All games part of doubleheaders in 2022 are scheduled as nine-inning games, following the implementation of seven-inning doubleheaders as part of health and safety protocols in 2020 and 2021.
Did you know that the number of teams eligible for the postseason increased from 10 to 12 in 2022? Under the new format: The number 1 and number 2 seeds (division winners with the two best records) in each League will receive a bye during the Wild Card Round. The Wild Card Round will feature the number 3 seed (division winner with the third-best record) against the number 6 seed (third Wild Card Club) and the number 4 seed (first Wild Card Club) against the number 5 seed (second Wild Card Club) in each League. The Wild Card Round will be a best-of-three series with all games played at the site of the number 3 and 4 seeds, respectively. The Division Series will remain a 2-2-1 format with the number 1 seed facing the winner of the 4/5 Wild Card matchup, while the number 2 seed faces the winner of the 3/6 Wild Card matchup.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2023 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
The World Baseball Classic was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, but the latest Collective Bargaining Agreement indicated the officially sanctioned international baseball tournament would return in 2023, and did it ever. Twenty teams competed, major league baseball stars were encouraged to participate, record numbers of fans witnessed games, and in the end, Japan defeated the United States 3–2.
Queen Elizabeth II passed away on September 8, 2022. Subsequently, on May 6, 2023, the Coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla took place at Westminster Abbey in London, England.
In the American League...
The Minnesota Twins unveiled new logos and uniforms for the 2023 season. The updated Twins script, and uniform numbers, had no shadows or outlines on the home whites or away navy blues, which will serve as an alternate home uniform as well. They wore white pants at home and gray pinstripes on the road.
Management changes in the junior circuit included two General Manager changes; Scott Harris took over with the Detroit Tigers, and Justin Hollander is the new Seattle Mariners GM. In the dugout, Phil Nevin is no longer an interim skipper, and now has the helm with the Los Angeles Angels, John Schneider replaced Charlie Montoya as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, Bruce Bochy replaced Chris Woodward with the Texas Rangers, and Pedro Grifol replaced the retiring hall of famer, Tony La Russa, with the Chicago White Sox.
Several American League teams announced plans to celebrate previous World Series titles, including the Baltimore Orioles, 40th Anniversary of 1983 World Series Championship, the Boston Red Sox, 10th Anniversary of 2013 World Series Championship, the New York Yankees, both the 25th Anniversary of 1998 World Series Championship and the 45th Anniversary of 1978 World Series Championship, as well as the Toronto Blue Jays, 30th Anniversary of 1993 World Series Championship.
In the National League...
The ""MLB World Tour"" continued in 2023, and this time it included the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres playing a two-game series at Alfredo Harp Helú Stadium in Mexico City, Mexico, on April 29-30, 2023. And the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs played a two-game series at London Stadium in London, England, on June 24-25, 2023.
Management changes in the senior circuit included Pete Putila taking over as General Manager of the San Francisco Giants. In the dugout, Rob Thomson is no longer an interim skipper, and now has the Philadelphia Phillies Manager title, and Skip Schumaker took over for Don Mattingly with the Miami Marlins.
On November 14, 2022, the Arizona Diamondbacks revealed a new anniversary logo, which was worn as a patch on their jerseys in 2023. The commemorative patch is marking the 25th anniversary of the franchise.
Around the League...
The 93rd All-Star Game was played on July 11, 2023. It was hosted by the Seattle Mariners at T-Mobile Park in Seattle, Washington. Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson managed the National League team, while Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker managed the American League team.
The MLB at Field of Dreams game was not played in 2023, due to the construction of a new youth baseball and softball complex at the Field of Dreams site in Dyersville, Iowa.
Three major rule changes took place in 2023; a pitch clock was introduced, infield shifts were severely restricted, and all three bases increased in size from 15 to 18 inches.
""Way-too-early Power Rankings, New Year's edition: 1. Astros. Repeating as World Series champions isn't easy, but the Astros probably deserve the benefit of the doubt. They've played in six straight AL Championship Series. They've won the World Series twice in that span. They have a starting staff that is six deep, which enabled them to let Justin Verlander, the AL Cy Young Award winner, leave for the Mets -- simply because they don't really need him. The 'World Series hangover' likely won't apply this year, considering Houston played two games over the minimum in the postseason and had multiple days of rest between each round. Though the AL West has improved in some areas -- the Mariners will be strong again, and the Rangers took measures to improve -- the Astros, again, will be the favorites to nab another division title."" - Footer, Alyson. MLB Staff Writer. Here are the first Power Rankings of 2023. 1 January 2023.

2023 American League Standings
Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association announced via Press Release (excerpts below) SEVERAL rule changes that will be in place during the 2023 baseball season, including:
Pitch Clock Implementation: A standardized period of 30 seconds between batters within each half-inning. A timer between pitches of 15 seconds with the bases empty, and 20 seconds with at least one runner on base. The pitcher must start his motion before the expiration of the pitch timer. A violation will result in an automatic ball. The batter must be in the box and alert to the pitcher with no less than eight seconds remaining. A violation will result in an automatic strike. With runners on base, the timer resets if the pitcher attempts a pickoff or steps off the rubber (collectively called a ""disengagement""). Only two disengagements are allowed per plate appearance; however, this count resets if a baserunner advances. Mound visits, injury timeouts, and offensive team timeouts do not count against this. On a third disengagement, an unsuccessful pickoff attempt will cause that runner to advance one base. If a team has used up all of its allowed five mound visits by the ninth inning, it receives an extra visit in the ninth. Umpires can provide extra time if circumstances warrant.
Infield Shift Restrictions: The defensive team must have no fewer than four players in infield positions, with at least two on each side of second base. All infielders must have both feet on or inside the outer edge of the marked infield while the pitcher is on the rubber. Infielders cannot switch sides of the infield before a pitch is released. If infielders are improperly aligned at the time of the pitch, the offensive team may choose to accept the result of the play, or receive an automatic ball.
A new balanced schedule was introduced in 2023, where every team will play every other team at least once during the regular season. It also includes 13 games against division rivals and 52 games overall against division opponents. Each team will play six games against six opponents, and seven games against four opponents in the same league, for a total of 64 games, as well as 46 interleague games.
Did you know that the number of teams eligible for the postseason increased from 10 to 12 in 2022 — giving us more participating postseason teams in 2023? Under the new format: The number 1 and number 2 seeds (division winners with the two best records) in each League will receive a bye during the Wild Card Round. The Wild Card Round will feature the number 3 seed (division winner with the third-best record) against the number 6 seed (third Wild Card Club) and the number 4 seed (first Wild Card Club) against the number 5 seed (second Wild Card Club) in each League. The Wild Card Round will be a best-of-three series with all games played at the site of the number 3 and 4 seeds, respectively. The Division Series will remain a 2-2-1 format with the number 1 seed facing the winner of the 4/5 Wild Card matchup, while the number 2 seed faces the winner of the 3/6 Wild Card matchup.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2024 AMERICAN LEAGUE
Off the field...
A new initiative, set forth by Major League Baseball, called MLB Spring Breakout will make its debut in 2024. Each franchise will put together a team of their best prospects to compete against other organization's prospects during a series of games, scheduled from March 14 to March 17, 2024.
Two former New York Mets players, Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, will each have their numbers retired. Doc will have his number (16) retired by the Mets on April 14, 2024, and The Straw Man will have his number (18) retired by the Mets on June 1, 2024.
In the American League...
Major League Baseball owners unanimously approved (November 16, 2024) the franchise request to relocate the Oakland Athletics, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2028.
The Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays played a spring training two-game series at Estadio Quisqueya, on March 9–10, 2024, the first Major League Baseball games ever played in the Dominican Republic.
Management changes in the junior circuit included three General Manager changes; Rick Hahn was fired by the Chicago White Sox, and replaced with Chris Getz; Brian O'Halloran was reassigned by the Boston Red Sox, and replaced with Craig Breslow; Peter Bendix, the Tampa Bay Rays GM, was hired by the Miami Marlins. In the dugout, the Angels did not pick up their option on Phil Nevin, and replaced him with Ron Washington; Terry Francona was reassigned by the Guardians, and Stephen Vogt was his replacement; and future hall of famer, Dusty Baker, retired as skipper of the Astros, Joe Espada took over at the helm.
In the National League...
The New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies are scheduled to participate in the MLB World Tour, playing a two-game series in London, England, on June 8–9, 2024, in London Stadium.
Management changes in the senior circuit included two General Manager changes; Billy Eppler was reassigned by the New York Mets, and replaced by David Stearns; and Kim Ng was reassigned by the Marlins, who hired the Rays GM (Peter Bendix). Managerial changes included; Bob Melvin taking over with the San Francisco Giants; Buck Showalter getting fired by the New York Mets, and replaced with Carlos Mendoza; San Diego Padres lost Melvin to the Giants, and named Mike Shildt their new skipper; the Milwaukee Brewers contract with Craig Counsell expired on November 1, 2023, and he left to the Chicago Cubs, prompting the Brew Crew to replace him at the helm with Pat Murphy.
The Arizona Diamondbacks unveiled a new uniform set, adding teal as a full-time accent color. Cream returned as the base color on the home uniforms for the first time since 2006, as is the alternate ""D-snake"" logo. Sand was removed entirely from the uniforms, except for the ""City Connect"" uniform.
Around the League...
The MLB World Tour continued in 2024, and this time it included the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres playing a two-game series in Seoul, South Korea, on March 20–21, 2024, in the Gocheok Sky Dome.
During the 2024 postseason, ESPN networks will air all four Wild Card Series, with Spanish–language simulcasts on ESPN Deportes. TBS will broadcast the American League Division Series and the American League Championship Series, with Spanish-language simulcasts on MLB Network. Fox Sports will broadcast the National League Division Series, the National League Championship Series, and the World Series, with Spanish-language simulcasts on Fox Deportes.
Four major rule changes took place in 2024; the pitch clock was reduced from twenty seconds to eighteen seconds; mound visits were reduced from five per game to four; the runner's lane was widened to include the dirt between the foul line and infield grass; and any pitcher who is sent out to warm up for an inning must face at least one batter.
""After a wild postseason that ended with the Texas Rangers winning their first World Series in franchise history, the 2023 Major League Baseball season is officially in the books. Now that the dust has settled, it’s time to start looking ahead to the 2024 campaign. While the odds for 2024 MLB futures bets will shift as the season unfolds, we already have a reasonable idea of how this year will play out and which clubs could be the last one standing. Despite falling short in 2023, the Los Angeles Dodgers are favored to win the 2024 World Series after signing two-time MVP Shohei Ohtani and Japanese pitching star Yoshinobu Yamamoto in December. The Dodgers’ most recent title was in 2020."" - Maher, Tyler. Forbes Staff Writer. World Series Odds: MLB Futures 2024. 26 February 2024.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1885 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Statue of Liberty arrived in New York aboard the French ship ISERE. Later assembled on Ellis Island in New York Harbor, the one-hundred fifty-one foot statue was a gift of international goodwill from the people of France to the people of the United States. She was completed and dedicated on October 28th, 1886 and was designated a National Monument on October 15th, 1924. The Statue was extensively restored in time for her spectacular centennial on July 4th, 1986 and today she is still considered THE universal symbol of political freedom and democracy.
In the National League...
The National League began its season with the founding franchise members including the Boston Beaneaters, Chicago White Stockings, Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, New York Giants, Philadelphia Phillies and Providence Grays. After the Union Association folded, the Cleveland Spiders and St. Louis Unions merged into a new National League franchise named the St. Louis Maroons. At the conclusion of the season, the Bison and Grays dropped out and were replaced by the Washington Senators and Kansas City Cowboys.
Spring Training began as Cap Anson and his Chicago White Stockings traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas to prepare for the upcoming season.
Art Irwin of the Providence Grays developed the first known fielder's glove after padding a buckskin glove to protect his two broken fingers.
In the American Association...
The American Association leading St. Louis Browns and National League champion Chicago White Stockings went head-to-head for six Championship games (winning three each) resulting in a rare tie. Despite the forming of a special committee to determine a winner, both teams were declared champions and split the $1,000 purse - $500 each.
Both the American Association and National League set a maximum pay cap at $2,000 with no bonuses.

Old Hoss Radbourn (59 wins) and Charlie Sweeney (17 wins) combined for 76-victories in 1884, the most by a pair of pitchers in baseball history. In 1885, Mickey Welch (44 wins), in his rookie season, and Tim Keefe (32 wins) tied their incredible record!
On June 6, 1885, the Chicago White Stockings defeated St. Louis 9-2 in the first game ever played in West Side Park.
On October 7, 1885, the Buffalo Bisons lost both ends of a doubleheader to the Providence Grays. Dupee Shaw actually won both ends of the doubleheader AND tossed a five inning no-hitter during the first game.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1886 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
A bombing at Haymarket Square in Chicago killed seven policemen and injured many others. The attack occurred during a demonstration for an eight-hour workday that was organized by eight alleged anarchists who were later arrested and accused of the crime. Following a speedy trial, three were imprisoned; one committed suicide and four others were hanged. In 1893, Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld pardoned the three survivors after accusations of an unfair trial surfaced.
In the National League...
Pitcher Jim McCormick of the Chicago White Stockings topped the New York Giants 7-3 on July 1st for his sixteenth consecutive win.
""The Bible of Baseball"" aka The Sporting News was established in St. Louis, Missouri. The publication began running in time for the baseball season, featuring all the National League games, and is still running through today.
In the American Association...
The American Association Champion St. Louis Browns took on the National League Champion Chicago White Stockings and beat them in six games for the Championship title.
Tip O'Neil of the Browns became the first player ever to hit two round-trippers in championship play after knocking two inside-the-park homers en route to a 12-0 massacre over Chicago.
Baltimore Orioles pitcher Matt Kilroy posted five-hundred thirteen strikeouts in sixty-eight games, but still finished the season with a 29-34 record and a last-place team.

Did you know that on May 31, 1886, New York played Detroit and attendance exceeded 20,000 for the first time in Major League history?
Why did we choose a Connie Mack quotation? Because he made his Major League debut on September 11, 1886, as a catcher with the Washington Senators.
On September 30, 1886, an agreement to play a best of seven winner take all ""World Series"" was accepted by the National League and American Association.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1887 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
English author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes story ""A Study in Scarlet"" was published. Doyle's brilliant and theatrical hero solved all of his extraordinarily complex cases through what he called ""ingenious deductive reasoning"". His companion, Dr. Watson, narrated the stories and both characters helped to redefine the mystery novel. Doyle later abandoned his medical practice in 1890 and devoted his time to writing. Other works of the great detective included The Sign of the Four (1890), The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902), The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905), His Last Bow (1917), and The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, (1927).
In the National League...
The Philadelphia Phillies finished off their 1887 season with an unprecedented sixteen consecutive wins.
Detroit Wolverines owner Frederick Stearnes challenged American Association St. Louis owner Chris Von Der Ahe to a best-of-fifteen Championship series. The Wolverines prevailed winning eight games. Despite appearing in sixteen post-season games, the Browns receive nothing for their efforts as Von Der Ahe refused to share his profits.
In the American Association...
St. Louis Browns first baseman/manager Charles Comiskey became the first baseball player ever paid to endorse a product after lending his name and likeness to Mennell's Penetrating Oil.
Thomas Ramsey of the Louisville Colonels introduced the ""knuckleball"" pitch, which helped him to fan seventeen batters in a single game — twice.
On April 16th, Mike Griffin of the Baltimore Orioles became the first player ever to homer in his first Major League at-bat.
""He (Sam Thompson) was known as an outstanding clutch hitter and he collected over 200 hits three times, twice topping the National League in home runs and RBI."" - National Baseball Hall of Fame

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1888 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Serial killer ""Jack the Ripper"" mutilated a number of prostitutes in the East End of London in 1888, setting off a mass hysteria throughout the city. The name ""Jack the Ripper"" originated from a letter apparently written by someone claiming to be the killer at the time of the murders. All five women were brutally slain within a one-mile area radius of each other in the districts of Whitechapel, Spitalfields, Aldgate, and the City of London proper. Despite one of the most intensive manhunts ever conducted by Scotland Yard detectives, ""The Ripper"" was never actually caught, although there were several suspects.
In the National League...
Charles Ferguson, a standout pitcher with the Philadelphia Phillies died on April 29th twelve days after his twenty-fifth birthday. Ferguson had been a thirty-game winner in 1886 and a twenty-game winner in each of his three other Major League seasons.
On July 13th, Harry Staley and Pud Galvin of the Pittsburgh Alleghenys became the first pitchers ever to combine for a double-header shutout after blanking Boston 4-0 and 6-0.
The National League champion New York Giants defeated the American Association's St. Louis Browns (four-time pennant winners) in an eight-game Championship series. Each player earned a $200 bonus plus an additional $128 from to following benefit games. St. Louis owner Chris Von Der Ahe kept the Browns $1,200 pennant purse while referring to his players as ""chumps"" in the papers. As a result, the team had now played in twenty-seven post-season games (over two seasons) without ever receiving a dime.
In the American Association...
American Association umpire John Gaffney changed the system for game calling after moving out from behind the plate — to behind the pitcher when a runner was on base.
Cincinnati Red Stocking fans were able to follow the game using the first ever baseball scorecard.
Perhaps the most famous baseball poem ever written ""Casey at the Bat"" was published in the San Francisco Examiner. Twenty-five year-old author Ernest L. Thayer was paid $5 for his efforts and was simply credited as ""Phin"".
""His (Jake Beckley) batting skill earned him the sobriquet of ""Old Eagle Eye"" as he hit .300 or better 13 times."" - National Baseball Hall of Fame

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1889 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
On June 1st, Americans awoke to the news that Johnstown, Pennsylvania had been devastated by the worst flood in U.S. history. Over 2,200 were dead, with many more homeless. Johnstown was a steel company town with a population of 30,000. It had grown quickly into an industrious community known for the quality of its steel. After a night of heavy rains, the South Fork Dam that protected the city collapsed, sending twenty million tons of water crashing down the narrow valley. Filled with huge chunks of debris, the wall of floodwater grew at times to sixty feet high, tearing downhill at forty miles per hour, leveling everything in its path.
In the National League...
John T. Brush approved a new salary classification plan based on rating players personal habits from A to E. Class ""A"" players received $2500 dollars while a Class ""E"" player was paid $1,500 dollars and expected to help clean the clubhouse. The Brotherhood of Professional Baseball Players was displeased with the policy, but managed to avert a strike by proposing the development of a third league.
William Hoy of the Washington Senators became the first outfielder ever to throw out three runners at the plate in a single game. Both deaf and mute from the age of three, Hoy played fourteen years in the majors while hitting .288 with forty home runs and seven-hundred twenty-six runs batted in.
On October 29th, the New York Giants defeated the Brooklyn Trolley-Dodgers in an early nine game version of the ""Subway Series"" world championship.
In the American Association...
The Louisville Colonels set an unwanted Major League record on June 22nd after suffering their twenty-sixth consecutive loss.
The Brooklyn Bridegrooms won the American Association pennant after defeating the Columbus Buckeyes 6-1 on October 14th.
Montgomery Ward organized a third league known as the ""Players League"" consisting of the Boston Reds, Brooklyn Wonders, Buffalo Bisons, Chicago Pirates, Cleveland Infants, New York Giants, Philadelphia Quakers and Pittsburgh Burghers. It was determined that all players moving into the new league for it's 1890 inaugural season would receive three-year contracts with guaranteed 1888 salaries for the first year and no subsequent pay-cuts.
""Did you know that he (Dummy Hoy) once threw three men out at home plate in one game? From the outfield, I mean. That was in 1889. And still they don't give him a tumble for the Hall of Fame. It's not right."" - Sam Crawford

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1890 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Due to a growing concern nationwide over economic power in large corporations, the U.S. Congress passed the first measure to prohibit trusts called the ""Sherman Antitrust Act"". The act, based on the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, declared illegal every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. A fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for one year was set as the maximum penalties for violating the law.
In the National League...
On Labor Day, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys were swept in a rare triple-header by the home team Brooklyn Bridegrooms 10-9, 3-2 and 8-4. The trio of winning pitchers included Bob Caruthers, Tom Lovett and Adonis Terry.
New York Giants slugger Mike Tiernan became the first player ever to hit a home run from one ballpark into another after launching a thirteenth inning blast off the Boston Beaneaters' Kid Nichols that traveled over the centerfield wall at the Polo Grounds into the adjacent Brotherhood Park.
In the American Association...
The Brooklyn Bridegrooms and Cincinnati Reds moved from the American Association to the National League who had also dropped the Washington Senators. The American Association's Kansas City franchise folded, but the Rochester Hop Bitters, Syracuse Stars, Toledo Maumees and Brooklyn Gladiators were added in their place.
Ledell ""Cannonball"" Titcomb tossed a 7-0 no-hitter against the Syracuse Stars on September 15th.
In the Players League...
The newly developed Players League debuted with eight teams (Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, New York Philadelphia and Pittsburgh) as the Buffalo Bisons recorded the greatest opening day winning margin with a 23-2 victory over the Cleveland Infants.
The short-lived Players League folded in December returning all of their players to their original teams. The Pittsburgh franchise deviated from the agreement though and signed second baseman Louis Bierbauer who had originally belonged to the Philadelphia Phillies. After being accused in the papers of being ""Pirates"" the team adopted the nickname and refused to return Bierbauer to their cross-state rivals.

On May 1, 1890, George Pinkney was spiked in a game versus Boston and had to leave the field. This ended his consecutive innings played record with more than five-thousand - a feat not matched until Cal Ripken, Jr. took the field during the 1980s.
On June 6, 1890, Harry Wright ""watched"" his Philadelphia club from the dugout. He was suffering from temporary blindness yet managed his team, thus becoming the only blind manager in history.
On August 16, 1890, Bill Phillips of Pittsburgh became the first pitcher to give up two grand slams, one to Tom Burns and one to Malachi Kittridge, during the same inning.

On May 1, 1891, League Park opened in Cleveland. On the mound for the Spiders that historic day was Cy Young, who defeated the Reds 12-3.
On August 25, 1891, the ""peace agreement"" was broken when the Boston Beaneaters signed crosstown Boston Red Stockings star player and future hall of famer King Kelly.
Do players steal more bases today then fifty years ago? How about one-hundred years ago? Discuss history on our message board and share with them the fact that Billy Hamilton stole more than one-hundred bases for three consecutive seasons over a century ago.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1892 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Owner Andrew Carnegie and plant manager Henry Clay Frick decided to break the steelworkers union at the Carnegie Steel Company plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Without warning, they locked out the steelworkers and hired three-hundred armed guards from the Pinkerton National Detective Agency to protect the non-union strikebreakers. When the Pinkertons arrived on barges, armed steelworkers attacked and defeated them in a bloody battle. Later, the state militia was called in to support Carnegie and ended both the labor conflict and the union.
In the National League...
Wilbert Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles set a Major League record after tallying seven hits in seven at-bats as his team topped the St. Louis Browns 25-4. Robinson also set a second record after driving in eleven runs with six singles and a double.
Due to the expanded number of teams, the season was split into two sections with the first concluding on July 15th and the second ending in October. The schedule consisted of 140-154 games with the addition of Sunday baseball, which was allowed for the first time in the National League.
The Boston Beaneaters defeated the Cleveland Spiders for the World Championship title. Team president Arthur Soden divided the $1000 purse between his thirteen players with each receiving $76.92 (or $12.82 per game).
""I ran like blazes down to first, And the crowd began to yell: Slide, Kelly, Slide!"" - George Gaskin

King Kelly, who was famous for his one-liners, was asked during the season if he ever drank (alcohol) while playing to which he replied, ""Depends on the length of the game!""
Why did we choose a line from the ""Slide, Kelly, Slide"" song for our page introduction? Because on the 9th of January it became the first baseball related song to appear on the music charts.
On June 6, 1892, President Benjamin Harrision watched Cincinnati defeat Washington 7-4. This was the first time in history where a U.S. President attended a Major League baseball game.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1903 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Automobile pioneer Henry Ford organized the Ford Motor Company. By cutting the costs of production and by adapting the conveyor belt and assembly line to automobile production, Ford was soon able to outdistance all his competitors to become the largest car manufacturer in the world. In 1908 he designed the infamous ""Model T"" and nearly seventeen million cars were produced worldwide before the model was discontinued in 1928. Later a new design called the ""Model A"" was created to meet growing competition.
In the American League...
On May 6th, the Chicago White Sox committed twelve errors, and the Detroit Tigers answered back with six of their own. The combined ""18-E debacle"" set a modern Major League record for the most errors (by two teams) in a single game.
Buck Freeman of the Boston Americans (Red Sox), completed a cycle on June 21, 1903, the first in franchise history. Just over a month later, Pat Dougherty, also with Boston, hit for the cycle as well. The Boston Americans became the second American League team with two cycles in the same season, joining the Philadelphia Athletics (1901).
At a post-season American League meeting, Ban Johnson was unanimously re-elected president and given a raise of $10,000. The American League owners also voted to allow base-running coaches at first and third at all times and to institute the ""foul strike"" rule in which a foul would be counted as a strike unless there are already two on the batter.
In the National League...
Fred Clarke hit for the cycle on May 7, 1903. Two years earlier, on July 23, 1901, Clarke had completed his first career cycle making him the first twentieth century player to hit for the cycle twice, and the first Pirate to ever complete two cycles in Pittsburgh.
Cincinnati Reds shortstop Tommy Corcoran set a Major League record after totaling fourteen assists in a 4-2 regulation win over the St. Louis Cardinals, on August 7, 1903. Lave Cross, of the Philadelphia Athletics, had originally racked up fifteen assists during a twelve-inning game in 1897.
The National League-leading Pittsburgh Pirates set an uncharacteristic National League mark for inept fielding after making six errors in the first inning of a 13-7 New York Giants victory on August 20th.
Around the League...
In Cincinnati, peace talks between both rival leagues continued as the Nationals proposed a consolidated twelve team league, which the Americans promptly rejected. Eventually an agreement was reached to coexist peacefully with the American League promising to stay out of Pittsburgh.
Baseball rules committee chairman Tom Loftus announced that the pitcher's box would not be more than fifteen inches higher than the baselines or home plate.
The inaugural World Series of 1903 was a resounding success and represented the first step in healing the bruised egos of both the veteran National and fledgling American Leagues. Pittsburgh and Boston went head-to-head for eight games proving that great baseball between the two leagues was possible and that a merger would benefit the growth of the sport. Unfortunately, some owners still disagreed with the concept and in 1904 it was prematurely cancelled.
""His misfortune was that he (Sam Crawford) played big league ball fifty years too early. If he were swinging today, he'd be up with the all-time home run leaders."" - Ty Cobb

On June 25, 1903, Wiley Piatt of the Boston Beaneaters pitched two complete games in one day versus Pittsburgh, and lost them both.
Jack Doscher made his Major League debut with the Chicago Cubs, on July 2, 1903. This debut made him and his father, Herm Doscher of Troy, the first father-son combination in Major League Baseball history!
Joe McGinnity accomplished the nearly impossible when he pitched and won both ends of a doubleheader on the same day. This, in and of itself, is remarkably rare; however, McGinnity repeated this fabulous feat three more times during the 1903 season.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1904 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The first section of the New York Subway system was opened between City Hall and 145th Street. The original system consisted of twenty-eight stations along 9.1 miles of track with the IRT extending to the Bronx in 1905, Brooklyn in 1908 and Queens in 1915. Since then, it has expanded to over two-hundred thirty miles of routes and over four-hundred miles of single track.
In the American League...
On May 11th, Sam Crawford of the Detroit Tigers broke Boston Red Sox ace Cy Young's consecutive streak of no-hit innings at 24 1/3 (seventy-six batters without a hit) after managing a one-out single en route to a 1-0 victory.
The St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers played a doubleheader on September 8, 1904, another doubleheader on the 9th, a third doubleheader on the 10th, then a fourth doubleheader on the 11th! After ""only"" one game on the 12th, they faced off for a final doubleheader on the 13th, setting a record for the most games played consecutively (11) between two teams in Major League Baseball history.
After pitching a record setting season with forty-one wins and four-hundred fifty-four innings in fifty-five games, New York Highlanders (Yankees) ace Jack Chesbro ""crashed and burned"" after losing control of a spitball that sailed over his catcher's head and allowed the American League pennant losing run to score from third.
In the National League...
New York Giants' Dan McGann stole five bases on May 27th during 3-1 win over the cross-town rival Brooklyn Dodgers. The record stood for seventy years until Davey Lopes of the Los Angeles Dodgers matched the mark in August of 1974. Atlanta Braves outfielder Otis Nixon eventually topped the feat with six steals (against the Montreal Expos) in 1991.
Frank Chance of the Chicago Cubs set a painful Major League mark after being hit four times in one day during a May 30th double header against the Cincinnati Reds. In the first game, ""The Peerless Leader "" actually lost consciousness after being tagged in the head by Jack Harper.
In October, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Jack Taylor tossed his thirty-ninth consecutive complete game of the season setting a modern Major League record. The streak started on April 15th and finished with an astounding three-hundred fifty-two innings pitched.
Around the League...
John T. Brush, president of the National League champion New York Giants, refused to play the returning American League champion Boston Americans. He was quoted as stating that he refused to compete with a ""representative of the inferior American League"". Surprisingly, Brush regretted the decision and later that year proposed to continue with the series as originally conceived. His about-face spawned the ""Brush Rules,"" a set of guidelines relating to the on-field play and off-field finances of the World Series, which exists to this day.
""He (Honus Wagner) was the nearest thing to a perfect player no matter where his manager chose to play him."" - John McGraw

Two senior circuit hitters completed a cycle in 1904; Duff Cooley joined the ""club"" first, on June 20, 1904, completing the second cycle by a Boston Beaneater (Atlanta Braves), followed by Sam Mertes, on October 4, 1904, the third cycle by a New York Giant (San Francisco Giants).
The Giants dominated the season from beginning to end. In September, John McGraw was asked about a postseason series with the winner of the American League pennant and he replied, ""When we clinch the National League pennant, we'll be champions of the only real Major League.""
On September 15, 1904, Hooks Wiltse won his twelfth consecutive game of his rookie season. Did you know that Butch Metzger tied this record for games won at the start of his career in 1976?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1905 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The ""Industrial Workers of the World"" (IWW) was founded in Chicago with the hopes of giving more control to unions. The aim of the IWW was to unite in one body all skilled and unskilled workers for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism by using direct action, propaganda, the boycott, and the strike. The IWW was also opposed the use of sabotage, arbitration, collective bargaining, and political affiliation. Unfortunately, recurring controversy during both World Wars along with accusations of treason caused dissention in the ranks from the top-down. From a probable strength of at least 30,000 in 1912, the membership later fell to less than 10,000 in 1930 and in the mid-1990s remained at less than 1,000.
In the American League...
A committee of Washington writers voted for ""Nationals"" as the new American League team nickname, but the ""Senators"" continued as the majority fan favorite.
New York Highlanders first baseman Hal Chase set a Major League record on August 5th with thirty-eight putouts during a doubleheader sweep (3-1, 6-5) versus the visiting St. Louis Browns.
In the National League...
On April 26th, Chicago Cubs outfielder Jack McCarthy tied a Major League record after starting three double plays to preserve a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Jackson Nelson had originally set the DP record in 1887.
Brooklyn Dodgers shortstop Phil Lewis earned his paycheck and tied a National League record on July 20th, after having eighteen chances for seven assists, six putouts and five errors en route to a 2-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds.
Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Dave Brain became the first player in National League history to hit three triples in a single game — twice in one season (vs. St. Louis and vs. Boston).
Boston Braves first baseman Fred Tenney completed the season with a National League record one-hundred fifty-two assists. The mark stood until 1986, when Sid Bream of the Pittsburgh Pirates topped it with one-hundred sixty-six.
Around the League...
New York Giants owner John T. Brush, who refused to play the American League pennant winners in 1904, proposed a new set of rules governing future World Series. Later known as the ""Brush Rules,"" these guidelines relating to the on-field play and off-field finances of the Series are still used to this day.
The National League Board of Directors acquitted St. Louis Cardinal right-hander Jack Taylor on the charges of throwing games. Despite the verdict, Taylor was still fined $300 for using poor judgment and practicing bad conduct.
On May 30th, both leagues posted record attendance figures for the Memorial Day holiday. Due to several doubleheaders, 80,963 attended eight American League games and 67,806 witnessed seven National League events.
""Look (Johnny) Evers, if you and I talk to each other, we're only going to be fighting all the time so don't talk to me, and I won't talk to you. You play your position, and I'll play mine, and let it go at that."" - Joe Tinker

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1906 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
More than five-hundred people were killed during the great San Francisco earthquake, which struck the ""City by the Bay"" on the morning of April 18 at 5:15 AM. Modern analysis estimated the tremors to register at an 8.25 on the Richter scale (By comparison, the quake that hit San Francisco on October 17, 1989 registered 6.7). The greatest destruction came from the fires that were ignited and the ensuing inferno ravaged the city for three days before burning out. In the end, the maelstrom destroyed four-hundred ninety city blocks, a total of 25,000 buildings and rendered over 250,000 residents homeless. Damage estimates topped $350,000,000.
In the American League...
The New York ban on Sunday baseball was temporarily lifted on April 29th as the Highlanders and Philadelphia Athletics played a benefit game for the victims of the San Francisco earthquake, raising $5,600.
St. Louis Browns first baseman Tom Jones recorded an American League record twenty-two putouts on May 11th against the Boston Red Sox. New York Highlander Hal Chase tied the record four months later (September 21), but would not be matched himself until Yankee captain Don Mattingly duplicated the effort during a 7-1 win over the Minnesota Twins on July 20, 1987.
In August, the Boston Americans set an unwanted Major League record after suffering four straight shutout losses (0-3 on August 2; 0-4 on August 3; 0-1 on August 4 and 0-4 on August 6).
In the National League...
On April 12th, Boston Braves outfielder Johnny Bates became the first modern player to hit a home run in his first Major League at bat. The inaugural round tripper came courtesy of Dodger Harry McIntire who lost twenty games or more in three seasons with Brooklyn's miserable turn-of-the-century teams.
New York Giants pitcher Hooks Wilste became the first pitcher of the modern era to strike out four batters in a single inning (after a third-strike error) en route to a twelve-K, 4-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. He also fanned the side in the fourth inning for a total of seven batters struck out in just two innings for the first and only time in Major League history.
On October 4th, the Cubs recorded their one-hundred sixteenth victory of the year. The 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates gave Chicago a 60-15-road record with a .800 percentage mark that has never been equaled. They also became the first team to finish with fewer than two-hundred errors and their pitching staff combined for a league-leading 1.76 ERA.
Around the League...
In an effort to curb accusations and/or suspicions of tampering, a new rule was set putting the umpire in sole charge of all game balls. (The home team manager previously had some say as to when a new ball was introduced).
Harry Pulliam was unanimously re-elected president of the National League with an increased salary of $10,000. The American League increased Ban Johnson's salary to $15,000 for the remaining four years of his contract.
Hank O'Day, a National League umpire unsuccessfully proposed that the batter's box be outlined with white rubber strips (rather than chalk) to prevent batters from erasing them with their spikes.
""But during a fifteen year career, from 1902 through 1916, he (Joe Tinker) saved his teams an astonishing two-hundred three fielding runs. He deserves his immortality."" - Total Baseball

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1907 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
In November, Oklahoma became the forty-sixth state admitted to the union. Originally set aside as Indian Territory in 1834, the region was later divided into both the Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory in 1890. Known primarily as an oil rich state, Oklahoma's vast plains produce bumper yields of wheat, as well as large crops of hay, cotton, and peanuts. Livestock products also contribute more than half of Oklahoma's annual farm receipts.
In the American League...
Popular Boston Americans outfielder / manager Chick Stahl committed suicide while traveling with the team in West Baden Springs, Indiana. A note left behind stated: ""Boys, I just couldn't help it. You drove me to it."" Cy Young reluctantly agreed to start the season as an interim replacement manager and was followed by two other skippers during the year, George Huff and Bob Unglaub.
Chicago White Sox pitcher Ed Walsh tallied eleven assists and two putouts during a 1-0 win over the St. Louis Browns on April 19, 1907. His total of thirteen chances tied the franchise mark set by Nick Altrock during the 1904 season — which is also the Major League record for most chances in a 9-inning game by a pitcher!
On June 28th, the last place Washington Nationals stole a Major League record thirteen bases off of injured New York Yankees catcher Branch Rickey. An injury to starter Red Kleinow forced Rickey into premature service and he was unable to throw accurately to his baseman.
In the National League...
A riot broke out during a July 8th, Chicago Cubs - Brooklyn Dodgers game after Cubs manager Frank Chance, who was being pelted with empty bottles, threw one back into the crowd hitting a young boy. After losing 5-0, the angry New York crowd rushed from the stands forcing Chance to escape Washington Park III in an armored car with a police escort.
At the West Side Grounds on September 14th, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds collected twenty-nine combined hits, ALL of which were singles.
On May 8th, Philadelphia Phillies rookie George McQuillan made his Major League debut in relief of starter Tully Sparks and McQuillan did not allow any runs to score during his brief debut. On September 22nd, he tossed a six-inning, 2-0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals in his first start. The relief and end of season appearance started a record string of twenty-five consecutive shutout innings at the beginning of his Major League career. McQuillan went on to finish the season 4-0 (with three shut outs), and went on to win twenty-three games the following season.
Around the league...
The Cleveland Indians became the first team to institute team wide insurance policies after taking out $100,000 of coverage to insure its players against possible injury in railroad accidents.
Cincinnati Reds' manager Ned Hanlon, one of the originals whose managing days began in 1889 at Pittsburgh, announced his retirement ending a career that boasted five Major League pennants (four Baltimore, one Brooklyn).
The Washington Post (incorrectly reported that St. Louis Browns shortstop Bobby Wallace was the highest paid major league player with a yearly salary of $6,500.

In 1906, Red Dooin of Philadelphia wore a set of paper-mache shin guards while catching a game. On April 11, 1907, Roger Bresnahan of New York wore the first set of standard shin guards behind the plate.
Miller Huggins, of Cincinnati, hit a leadoff home run against Christy Mathewson on June 19, 1907. The fans were so excited they gave Huggins chocolates, a pin, a watch, and a Morris Chair.
On August 11, 1907, Ed Karger of St. Louis started the second end of a doubleheader versus Boston. The game was pre-set at seven innings and Karger became the first pitcher to hurl a perfect game that was less than the common nine-inning variation.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1908 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
President Theodore Roosevelt held the ""White House Conservation Conference"", which later led to the establishment of the National Conservation Commission. The main purpose of the Commission was to implement new regulations for conserving the earth's natural resources by protecting its capacity for self-renewal. Particularly complex were the problems of nonrenewable energy resources such as oil and coal and other minerals that are still in great demand today.
In the American League...
On April 14th, Boston played their first game under the new nickname, the ""Red Sox"" and christened it with a 3-1 win over the Washington Senators at the Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds.
The Detroit Tigers set a unique Major League record on June 7th after turning a triple play against the Boston Red Sox for the second day in a row.
Bob Rhoads, of the Cleveland Naps, tossed a no-hitter on September 18, 1908, against the newly named BoSox. Cleveland wins 2-to-1.
In the National League...
In March, Honus Wagner announced his retirement from the Pittsburgh Pirates at the age of thirty-four. Despite the intention, he went on to play in one-hundred fifty-one games (more than in any of the past ten years) and led the league in hitting (for the sixth time), hits, total bases, doubles, triples, RBIs, and stolen bases.
On May 23rd, New York Giants third baseman Art Devlin tied a Major League record by handling thirteen total chances during a 6-2 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.
Around the League...
In 1908, the original sacrifice fly rule was adopted. It stated: No ""time at bat"" was charged — if a run scored after the catch of a fly ball. The rule was later repealed in 1931 and went through several variations before permanent acceptance in 1954.
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary (after a two-year investigation by the Mills Committee) National League president A.G. Mills declared that Abner Doubleday had indeed, invented the sport of baseball at Cooperstown, New York in 1839.
Henry Chadwick, a leading reporter, commentator, scorer, and promoter of the game, died in Brooklyn at the age of eighty-three. Chadwick was known as ""The Father of Baseball"" and is credited with developing the initial scoring and statistical systems for the game.
Singing sensation Billy Murray hit the charts with ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"".
""The first scheme for playing Baseball, according to the best evidence to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, N.Y. in 1839."" - The Mills Commission

During 1839, the year mentioned in the quote at the top of the page, Abner Doubleday was a cadet at West Point. Author Wells Twombly once wrote, ""The Doubleday diaries suggest that instead of going home to Cooperstown, New York, in the summer of 1839, he stayed on duty at West Point.""

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1909 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United States military intervened to aid in the removal of President Jose Santos Zelaya from Nicaragua. Since 1893, Zelaya had been trying to create a union of Central American countries by intervening actively in their affairs. After he began executing those who opposed him (including two Americans) the U.S. took over the rebel faction and ousted him promptly.
In the American League...
On April 27th, the Chicago White Sox won their third 1-0 game over the St. Louis Browns in three days, setting an early American League record for consecutive 1-0 wins. Hits in all three games (by both teams combined) totaled a meager eighteen.
The Chicago White Sox also set a modern Major League record on July 2nd after stealing twelve bases (three of home) during a 15-3 massacre over the St. Louis Browns at South Side Park III.
Detroit Tigers legend Ty Cobb clinched the American League home run title after hitting nine, inside-the-park round-trippers. In doing so, he became the only player of the century to lead a league in home runs without ever actually hitting one ""out of the park"".
In the National League...
The National League deprived umpires of the ability to levy fines and declared that all relief pitchers must retire at least one batter before being relieved themselves.
Pittsburgh Pirate Honus Wagner stole his way around the bases in the first inning of a May 2nd nightcap against the Chicago Cubs. In doing so, Wagner set a National League record as the first player ever to pull off the feat three times. Amazingly, he would duplicate the effort again the following day.
On July 3rd, the St. Louis Cardinals tied an unwanted Major League mark after committing seventeen individual errors during a doubleheader loss to the Cincinnati Reds, (10-2 and 13-7).
Around the League...
Play-By-Play, broadcasting came one step closer as the first use of wireless technology to transmit baseball results was conducted at the Columbia University Wireless Club. The proceedings of the game between the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia were relayed from the Bellevue-Stratford in Philadelphia to New York's Waldorf Astoria, where Columbia students received the messages.
National League President John Heydler called an emergency meeting with the league's officials to propose a new two-umpire system for preventing fights with the players.
In June, Benjamin Shibe, of Bala, Pennsylvania, obtained a patent for a new cork-centered baseball. Spalding Sporting Goods later licensed the idea and began manufacturing it for distribution in both the major and minor leagues.
""He (Honus Wagner) was a gentle, kind man, a storyteller, supportive of rookies, patient with the fans, cheerful in hard times, careful of the example he set for youth, a hard worker, a man who had no enemies and who never forgot his friends. He was the most beloved man in baseball before Ruth."" - Bill James

Did you know that Red Ames of the New York Giants no hit the Brooklyn Superbas, on April 15, 1909, through nine innings, but surrendered a tenth inning hit, losing what would have been the first no-hitter during an Opening Day game?
On July 28, 1909, National League president Henry Pulliam shot himself in the head in his room at the New York Athletic Club. At a banquet in February, Pulliam forecasted this event when he said, ""My days as a baseball man are numbered. The National League does not want me as president anymore.""
Arlie Latham was chosen by John McGraw to be the Giants first full-time coach. Later that day (August 18, 1909), Latham — who is a player-coach — steals second base to become the oldest player to date, at age forty-nine, to steal a base.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1910 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Boy Scouts of America was introduced inviting boys eleven to seventeen years old an opportunity to join an organization dedicated to improving mental, moral, and physical development while stressing outdoor skills and training in citizenship and lifesaving. Originally, the movement was intended to be nonmilitary and without racial, religious, political, or class distinctions, but the Supreme Court affirmed the organization's right to limit membership to those who believe in God in 1993.
The ""National Association for the Advancement of Colored People"" was founded in New York, in November. The N.A.A.C.P. originally published an underground journal called ""The Crisis,"" and was at the forefront of all the attempts by Blacks to achieve equality. For more than ninety-three years, the NAACP has continued include people of all races, nationalities and religious denominations, while remaining united on one premise, that all men and women are created equal.
In the American League...
Cleveland Indians ace Cy Young won his five-hundredth game on July 19th after beating the Washington Senators 5-4 at American League Park II.
Washington Senators second baseman Red Killefer set a Major League mark on August 27th after sacrificing four times in the first game of a Detroit Tigers doubleheader.
Eddie Collins of the Philadelphia Athletics set an American League record after stealing his eighty-first base of the season, on October 4, 1910, during an 8-1 victory over the visiting Boston Red Sox.
In the National League...
The Braves and Phillies combined on April 22nd for a Major League record fewest at bats by two teams in nine innings: forty-eight (twenty-five for Boston, twenty-three for Philadelphia). The record was tied the following season, but remained unbeaten until 1964.
On August 13th, the Pittsburgh Pirates and Brooklyn Dodgers played in perhaps, the most evenly matched game ever. Both teams finished the 8-8 tie (called on darkness) with exactly eight runs, thirteen hits, thirty-eight at bats, five strikeouts, three walks, one hit batter, one passed ball, thirteen assists, twenty-seven putouts and two errors with two pitchers used. [Box Score]
Around the League...
William Howard Taft became the first U.S. president to throw out the ceremonial ""first pitch"" after he opened the 1910 season at Washington's League Park. The Senators' Walter Johnson christened the tradition by pitching a one-hitter, beating the Philadelphia Athletics and Eddie Plank 3-0.
Both leagues agreed to adopt a resolution that would ban syndicate baseball, which had previously allowed owners to have financial interests vested in more than one team. They also mandated that all umpires were to announce any team changes to the spectators; batting orders were to be delivered to the head umpire at home plate before the game and a base runner was to be called out if he passed another runner ahead of him on the base path.
""I like it (baseball) for two reasons. First, because I enjoy it myself and second, because if by the presence of the temporary first magistrate such a healthy amusement can be encouraged, I want to encourage it."" - President Taft

Off the field...
On March 25th, the worst factory fire in the history of New York City occurred after the Triangle Shirtwaist Company burned down. The horrific incident had an even greater significance as it revealed the inhumane working conditions to which industrial workers were subjected. Employees at the factory consisted mostly of poor Jewish immigrants between the ages of thirteen and twenty-three and to keep the women at their sewing machines, the proprietors locked the doors leading to the exits. After a fire broke out on the eighth floor, many panicking workers rushed to the stairs, the freight elevator, and the fire escape. Dozens on the ninth floor died, unable to force open the locked door to the exit and the rear fire escape collapsed, killing many and eliminating an escape route for others. Although Pump Engine Company 20 and Ladder Company 20 arrived quickly (along with four other companies) the bodies of victims who had jumped hindered them from entering the building. In the end, a total of one-hundred forty-six women died in less than fifteen minutes bringing to the attention of the nation a need for more humane and safe working conditions in America's factories.
In the American League...
On June 18th, the Detroit Tigers staged the biggest comeback in Major League history after overcoming a 13-1 deficit (after 5½ innings) to defeat the Chicago White Sox by a score of 16-15.
On September 28th, several hundred fans witnessed what is considered to be one of the worst contests in American League history as the New York Yankees and St. Louis Browns combined to accumulate twenty-four hits, twenty walks, twelve errors and fifteen stolen bases en route to an 18-12 (NY) final.
In the National League...
On May 22nd, Boston Braves pitcher Cliff Curtis set a Major League record by recording his twenty-third consecutive loss (beginning on June 13, 1910) with a 3-1 deficit against the St, Louis Cardinals.
Frank Schulte completed the season leading the National League in home runs (21) and RBIs (107); and also became the first player to have more than twenty doubles, twenty triples, and twenty home runs in a single season!
Philadelphia Phillies ace Grover Alexander dominated the month of September after tossing complete game shutouts on the 7th, 13th, 17th and 21st.
Around the League...
The idea of selecting a Most Valuable Player was introduced after automobile maker Hugh Chalmers offered a brand new car to the MVP in each league to be chosen by a select committee of baseball writers.
The Pennsylvania Railroad set a speed record on May 29th after transporting the Chicago Cubs one-hundred ninety-one miles from Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh in two-hundred fifteen minutes. After arriving at the game, the Cubs showed some speed of their own and beat the Pirates 4-1.
The Federal Express of the Hartford Railroad (carrying the St. Louis Cardinals to Boston) plunged down an eighteen-foot embankment outside Bridgeport, Connecticut, killing fourteen passengers. Fortunately, no players were injured, and each helped to remove bodies and rescue the injured.
""I give Charlie Faust full credit for winning the pennant for me - the National League pennant of 1911."" - New York Giants' manager John McGraw

On July 10, 1911, the first ""possible"" ejection with a fan took place (it was in Philadelphia and the Cubs were in town) when umpire Bill Klem reportedly told the fan, ""Sir, you did not buy that seat to insult ballplayers.""

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1912 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
American journalist and publisher, William Randolph Hearst began to acquire his media empire that would eventually include eighteen newspapers and nine magazines within two decades. A flamboyant and highly controversial figure, Hearst was nonetheless an extremely competent newspaperman who quickly became one of the wealthiest men in the world. His castle at San Simeon, California, won fame for its immense art collections and is still considered one of the largest houses in the United States. The property was later presented to the state as a museum after Hearst's death.
In the American League...
While playing the Boston Red Sox in their opener at New York's Hilltop Park, the New York Highlanders debuted their ""soon-to-be"" trademark pinstripes.
One of baseball's original cathedrals, Boston's Fenway Park, (built at a cost of $350,000) was formally dedicated as the visiting White Sox beat the Red pair 5-2 before a capacity crowd.
On August 11th, Joe Jackson of the Cleveland Indians became only the second American League player ever to steal home twice in a single game. Jackson first stole home in the first, then went on to thieve second, third and home in the seventh.
In the National League...
Crosley Field, the home field of the Cincinnati Reds until June 24, 1970, opened its doors to fans on May 18, 1912. Originally called Redland Field (the name changed in 1933), 20,000 fans witnessed the first game in ballpark history, a 4-3 win over the New York Giants, who started Christy Mathewson that historic day.
The St. Louis Cardinals also ended the New York Giants consecutive winning streak at fourteen after a 5-1 effort on May 31st. The Giants incredible start of 43-11 remained the best of the century and stood unmatched until 1939 when the New York Yankees tied the mark.
In response to the demand for an alternative way to statistically rate pitchers, the National League elected to officially score the Earned Run Average for the first time. Jeff Tesreau of the New York Giants went on to lead the new category with a 1.96 ERA.
Around the League...
In an effort to eliminate the possibility of home team's ball boys influencing which ones are used for each team's turn at bat, the National League installed small boxes near home plate to supply the umpires directly.
In New York, the Giants and Highlanders met at the Polo Grounds to play an unscheduled charity game to raise money for the survivors of the Titanic (which had sunk three days earlier, April 14th). The Giants prevailed 11-2.
As a gag, Western Union telegraph operator Lou Proctor entered his name as a pinch hitter into the St. Louis Browns — Boston Red Sox box score (with no hits in one at bat). Initially, the forgery was not noticed and appeared both as a published box score in The Sporting News and in the first editions of The Baseball Encyclopedia.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1913 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution (for income tax) was adopted stating that: ""Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""
One of the most important exhibitions of art ever held in the United States, ""The Armory Show"" aroused the curiosity of the public and helped to change the direction of American painting. An estimated 1,600 works including paintings representing many avant-garde movements from Europe were revealed to mixed reviews. Duchamp's ""Nude Descending a Staircase"" was singled out by the hostile critics as a prime example of the ""degeneracy"" of the new art. Later, many of the same paintings would become modern masterpieces commanding millions of dollars in value.
In the American League...
The New York Yankees became the first team to practice outside the United States after they traveled to Bermuda for spring training.
On May 14th, Walter ""The Big Train"" Johnson topped Jack Coombs with a record of fifty-six straight scoreless innings as his Washington Senators beat the St. Louis Browns 10-5 at Sportsman's Park III.
The Boston Red Sox set a Major League record for frustration on July 3rd after totaling fifteen hits off the Washington Senators' Walter Johnson during a 1-0 shutout.
In the National League...
Philadelphia Phillies ace Erskine Mayer set an unwanted National League mark on August 18th after surrendering nine consecutive hits to the Chicago Cubs (all in the ninth-inning) en route to a 10-4 loss.
In September, Pittsburgh Pirate Honus Wagner was presented with a commemorative bat carved from a piece of wood taken from naval hero Oliver Perry's flagship Niagara (which had sunk in Lake Erie one-hundred years before). Wagner had been the first player ever to have his signature scrawled on a Louisville Slugger (1905).
Around the League...
American League President Ban Johnson and Detroit Tigers President Frank Navin both voiced complaints on the extensive length of the games, which were taking up to two hours to play. Both blamed several rules and regulations including the location of the ""coachers boxes"" and proposed that they be moved back so that the catcher could relay the pitcher his signals more quickly.
After ruling that a ballplayer on the field was considered a ""public person,"" a New York judge tossed out several cases (brought by both New York and Boston players) against a motion picture company that had apparently taken film of the 1912 World Series.
In December, The Sporting News reported that fifteen men (none well known) had died from various baseball-inflicted injuries during the 1913 season, according to a list compiled by J.R. Vickery of Chicago.
""He (Gavvy Cravath) led the NL in homers six times. Anyone who leads in any major category for a decade, and who leads the league half a dozen times, is a star in my book."" - The Diamond Angle

On April 9, 1913, Charlie Ebbets' field of dreams opened its doors to 10,000 fans who watched as the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the hometown Brooklyn Superbas 1-0.
Trivia alert: Which game took two months to complete? It all started on August 30, 1913, when umpire William Brennan awarded a forfeit victory to the Giants over the Phillies due to Philadelphia fans distracting the New York hitters. Three days later National League president Thomas Lynch overturned the forfeit and awarded the victory to the Phillies who were leading 8-6 when the distractions took place. A board voted to resume the game and on October 2, 1913, the Phillies retired the final two Giants batters to earn the victory.
Did you know that Larry Cheney of the Cubs set a new National League record for most hits (14) allowed during a shutout (7-0 vs Giants) on September 14, 1913?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1914 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United States finally completed the construction of the Panama Canal. The fifty-one mile long waterway ran across the Isthmus of Panama, connecting the Atlantic (by way of the Caribbean Sea) and Pacific oceans. After the United States acquired territory in the Caribbean and in the Pacific as a result of the Spanish–American War (1899), U.S. control over a man-made canal seemed imperative. In 1912, ""The Panama Canal Act"" was passed (exempting tolls from American cargo ships engaged in coastwise trade) igniting a protest by Great Britain that was eventually repealed in 1914 through the efforts of President Woodrow Wilson.
In the American League...
Cleveland Naps shortstop Ray Chapman stumbled his way into an unwanted record on June 20th after committing four errors in the fifth inning during a 7-1 loss to the New York Yankees at League Park II.
During the second game of an August 24th doubleheader in Washington, Detroit Tigers pitcher Hooks Dauss combined with four Senators aces to hit a record seven batters for a Major League mark that remained unmatched until the 1971 season.
In September, New York Yankees shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh replaced Frank Chance to become the club's all-time youngest skipper (twenty-three), and the seventh in its twelve-year existence. He later went on to win nine of seventeen games and eventually managed Cleveland in 1928.
In the National League...
On June 9th at the Baker Bowl, Pittsburgh Pirate legend Honus Wagner joined Cap Anson as the only other member of the ""3,000 Hit Club."" Wagner collected the historic double off the Philadelphia Phillies' Erskine Mayer in the ninth-inning of his two-thousand three-hundred thirty second game.
Pittsburgh and New York went head-to-head for a twenty-one innings on July 17th before Larry Doyle's two-run home run sealed a 3-1 Giants victory over the Pirates. The Forbes Field marathon set a Major League mark as the longest ""non-walk game"" in the history of organized baseball.
Brooklyn Dodgers first baseman Jake Daubert tied a Major League mark on August 15th after recording four sacrifice bunts in the second game of a doubleheader sweep against the Philadelphia Phillies (8-4, 13-5). Daubert had also placed two sacrifice bunts in the first game after an ankle injury impeded his ability to run.
In the Federal League...
1914 debuted the short-lived Federal League after John T. Powers of Chicago convinced a group of entrepreneurs that the growing popularity of baseball could support a third major league. Eight teams entered the inaugural season with clubs based in Brooklyn, Chicago, St. Louis and Pittsburgh as well as Baltimore, Kansas City, Buffalo and Indianapolis which had been the home for AAA teams. All eight cities constructed brand new ballparks including the Chicago Whales who played in what would eventually be known as Wrigley Field.
To effectively compete, the owners lured eighty-one former Major League players (eighteen of which were active) and one-hundred forty Minor League players (twenty-five of which were active) into the Federal League Baseball Company, Inc.
On May 6th, Pittsburgh Rebel Ed Lennox collected the only Federal League cycle during a 10-4 win over the Kansas City Packers.
Around the League...
A joint committee representing both the American and National Leagues voted that a ""runner touched or held by a coach while rounding third base was officially out"" and that ""coaches could now assist other members of their team, not just the base runners"". Pitchers were also allowed to stand on the rubber (vs. standing behind the rubber until ready to pitch) and base runners were no longer permitted to run on an infield fly. A motion to eliminate the intentional walk was also rejected along with an attempt to legalize Sunday baseball in Massachusetts.
In April, the twenty-five player limit was suspended in both the American and National Leagues. With uncertainty over who has signed with what teams, it was almost impossible to verify how many players could be on any club's roster at any one time.
On April 22nd, a nineteen year-old pitcher named Babe Ruth made his debut in the International League with a six-hit, 6-0 win for Baltimore over Buffalo. The second batter he faced was Joe McCarthy, the manager he would later play for as a New York Yankee.
""I've got sixteen pitchers and they're all rotten."" - Boston Braves Manager George Stallings

Johnny Evers was ejected by umpire Mal Eason for swearing on September 10, 1914. Evers claimed he was speaking to the baseball, but received a 3-day suspension anyway!

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1915 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Superior Court in Fulton County, Georgia accepted the charter for the establishment of the new Ku Klux Klan on December 4th. The first Ku Klux Klan was an organization that thrived in the South during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Subsequent groups calling themselves by the same name sprang up in much of the South after both World War I and II and in response to civil-rights activity during the 1960s. In spite of its efforts, the new Klan was not strong, and by the end of the 1960s its nationwide power and membership had declined into a small, underground movement.
Ford rolled its one-millionth automobile off the Michigan assembly line, which was responsible for manufacturing half of all cars in America. To meet the growing demands of his ""Model T"" automobiles, Henry Ford had opened a large factory at Highland Park, in 1910. There, the industrial visionary invented precision building, interchangeable parts and a continuous moving assembly line that revolutionized automobile production by significantly reducing assembly time per vehicle as well as labor costs.
In the American League...
On May 6th, an ""up-and-coming"" pitcher for the Boston Red Sox nicknamed ""The Babe"" hit his first major league homerun off the Yankees Jack Warhop at New York's Polo Grounds.
A back-up catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics named Wally Schang set an American League record after nailing six would-be St. Louis base stealers during a 3-0 loss to the Browns on May 12, 1915.
On June 23rd, Detroit's Ty Cobb stole home (again) for the fifth time in the month en route to a 4-2 Tiger victory over the St. Louis Browns. ""The Georgia Peach"" would finish the season with ninety-six.
In the National League...
Making his National League debut, St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Lee Meadows became the first player to wear glasses regularly on the field. Later that season, Carmen Hill of the Pittsburgh Pirates became the second.
On August 18th, Wilbur Good became the only Chicago Cub ever to steal second, third, and home — all in the same inning. His teammates followed his ""good"" example and went on to beat the Brooklyn Dodgers 9-0.
In the Federal League...
After a lengthy contract dispute instigated by the Federal League's high salary structures, ""Home Run"" Baker announced his early retirement from the Philadelphia Athletics at the tender age of twenty-eight. Manager Connie Mack also experienced salary problems with several other players including Chief Bender, Eddie Plank, and Jack Coombs. Refusing to compete with the rival league's higher pay scale, Mack decided to release the stars and sell Baker to the Yankees after the 1915 season.
In December, organized baseball agreed to a formal ""peace treaty"" with the Federal League ending a two-year political war. The Federals agreed to disband after the American and National Leagues both agreed to pay an enormous sum of $600,000 for distribution to owners, absorb two franchises (one American League and one National League) and recognize all former players as eligible picks at a Fed-controlled auction.
Around the League...
The Federal League sued organized baseball, claiming it to be an illegal trust and demanding that it be dissolved with all contracts voided. The case was formally filed in the U.S. court in Chicago, before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis and the future baseball commissioner intentionally stalled his decision while waiting for peace to be declared at the end of the year.
The American League officially banned the emery ball, a pitch introduced by Russ Ford in 1910. Ford had accidentally discovered that a scuffed baseball could be made to break sharply while a semi-pro pitcher. He began intentionally doctoring the ball using emery paper, and disguised his pitches as spitballs, which at the time were legal.
On ""Suffrage Day"", 4,100 women bought tickets to see the Giants take on the Chicago Cubs in New York. As a publicity stunt, the suffragettes announced that they would pay five dollars to each player who scored a run. Unfortunately, ""Wildfire"" Frank Schulte emerged as the only recipient after leading a Chicago ""double-steal"" in the first inning.
""The Phillies rode the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the slugging of outfielder Gavvy Cravath to their first National League flag. Alexander tossed four one-hitters and won 31 games in 1915 (the first of three straight years in which he reached the 30-victory mark). Cravath slammed 24 home runs - a major-league high to that point in the century - and drove in 115 runs."" - The Sporting News

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1916 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Montana voters elected thirty-six year-old Republican Jeannette Rankin as the first woman in the United States to serve in Congress. A strong proponent of peace, Rankin voted against the declaration of war on Germany in 1917 and in 1941, she cast the only vote in the House against entering WWII. A member of various antiwar organizations over the years, she led the ""Jeannette Rankin Brigade"", a peace group, to Washington to protest the Vietnam War in 1968.
Congress officially established The National Park Service as a bureau in the Department of the Interior. The system included not only the most extraordinary and spectacular scenic exhibits in the United States, but also a large number of sites distinguished either for their historic or prehistoric importance or scientific interest, or for their superior recreational assets. Today, the National Park System is made up of over three-hundred seventy-five areas covering more than eighty-three million acres in every state except Delaware.
In the American League...
On April 11th, the World Champion Boston Red Sox suffered an embarrassing 1-0 loss during an exhibition game against the young men from Boston College.
Cleveland Indians catcher Steve O'Neill completed an amazing thirty-six double plays for a Major League season record for catchers that still stands to date.
On May 9th, the Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit Tigers combined to set a Major League record with thirty walks during a 16-2, ""Motor City"" win. Eighteen were issued by the A's, (who went on to finish the season with 715). Detroit added eleven more the following day for a two-game Major League record of twenty-nine.
In the National League...
The National League, which was celebrating its fortieth anniversary, voted down a proposal by the New York Giants, Boston Braves, and Chicago Cubs to increase their player limit from twenty-one to twenty-two.
On June 22nd, the Boston Braves pulled off the only National League extra-inning triple steal to beat the New York Giants 3-1 in the eleventh. In 1941, the American League would match the feat with their only recorded triple swipe.
Chicago Cubs catcher Bill Fischer set a Major League record by catching all twenty-seven innings in a doubleheader loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 28th.
Around the League...
In January, the National Association released a list of one-hundred twenty-three Federal League players with free-agent status under the terms of the new leagues ""peace agreement"". The following month, the Federal League's year-old suit charging antitrust violations by organized baseball was dismissed by mutual consent in the U.S. District Court by Judge Kenesaw M. Landis.
Chicago Cubs owner Charles Weeghman became the first to officially allow fans to keep any and all balls hit into the stands. His decision followed an incident in which a fan fought with park attendants after catching a foul ball during the St. Louis Cardinals' series.
""I did not say my players did not try to win, but they refused to obey my orders and it was too much for me and I lost my patience. Such baseball disgusts me and I left the bench."" - New York Giants manager John McGraw on October 3, 1916

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1957 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
President Dwight D. Eisenhower deployed Federal troops to uphold the integration of public schools in Little Rock, Arkansas after local authorities refused to implement court-ordered desegregation. Little Rock Mayor Woodrow Mann had sent the President a telegram asking for assistance in maintaining order and completing the integration process. The President responded by sending 1,000 members of the 101st Airborne Division and federalizing the 10,000-man Arkansas National Guard. On September 25th, nine black students finally entered Central High School under Army escort.
In the American League...
Ted Williams set an American League record after being intentionally walked thirty-three times during the regular season. It was the highest American League total since the league had started compiling the statistic in 1955.
On June 2nd, New York Yankees ace Whitey Ford fanned six batters in a row to tie an American League record as he shut out the Chicago White Sox 3-0.
Bob Keegan of the Chicago White Sox tossed the only no-no of the season (in either league) on August 20th, shutting down the Washington Senators who were going to lose 99 games and finish forty-three games out of first.
In the National League...
On August 17th, Richie Ashburn of the Phillies proved that lightning could strike twice after hitting spectator Alice Roth twice in the same at bat. The first foul struck the wife of Earl Roth, sports editor at the Philadelphia Bulletin in the face and the second hit her body while she was being removed from her seat on a stretcher. Mrs. Roth went on to the hospital to be treated for a broken nose and Philadelphia went on beat the New York Giants 3-1.
The Brooklyn Dodgers tied a National League record on August 24th after using eight pitchers during a single game. The expanded rotation failed miserably as the first-place Milwaukee Braves dominated the entire bullpen for a 13-7 massacre. The Dodgers' Johnny Podres surrendered three home runs in the fourth and Hammerin' Hank Aaron added insult to injury with the first grand slam of his career. The St. Louis Cardinals also tied the record on September 21st while losing 9-8 (in ten innings) against the Cincinnati Reds.
Milwaukee Braves' ace Warren Spahn hurled the forty-first shutout of his career during an 8-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs on September 3rd setting a new National League record for left-handed pitchers.
Around the League...
The Dodgers became the first Major League baseball team to own their own plane after they purchased a forty-four passenger, twin-engine airliner for $775,000 to transport the club during the season.
The Associated Press named Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Jack Sanford as its National League Rookie of the Year and the Milwaukee Braves' Henry Aaron as the 1957 National League Most Valuable Player with two-hundred thirty-nine votes. Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals was a close second with two-hundred thirty. On the American League side, Tony Kubek of the Yankees was elected the American League Rookie of the Year and teammate Mickey Mantle edged out Red Sox rival Ted Williams two-hundred thirty-three to two-hundred nine votes to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award.
After the Minor Leagues threatened to sue Major League Baseball if Sunday games were televised in their territory, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) announced that it would not broadcast any big league match-ups at the time a Minor League game was scheduled.
New York City Mayor Robert Wagner formed an exclusive four-member committee to find a National League ""replacement team"" for the vacating Dodgers and Giants.
""If thirteen major league teams can come up with colored players, why can't the other three?"" - Jackie Robinson (1957 retirement comment about Philadelphia, Boston & Detroit)

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1958 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United States launched its first satellite ""Explorer I"" into orbit around the earth. The launch was in response to the Soviets who had successfully launched their first satellite ""Sputnik"" one year earlier.
U.S. Troops landed in Lebanon for the first time after President Eisenhower ordered approximately five-thousand U.S. Marines deployed to help maintain order after a revolt in Iraq resulted in the ouster of the pro-Western Lebanese government.
Pan Am introduced the first 707 trans-Atlantic jet service on October 27, when its first 707 airliner, christened the ""Clipper America"", took off for Paris, France from New York.
In the American League...
Cleveland Indian Vic Power became the first American League player since 1927 to steal home twice in the same game. The crafty first baseman first stole home in the eighth inning, then again in the tenth giving the Indians a 10-9 win over the Detroit Tigers.
Two walks and a hit batsman are all that Jim Bunning allowed as he won his sixth game in seven decisions and tossed the only American League no hitter of the season on July 20.
Boston's Ted Williams hit the 17th grand slam of his career (along with a three-run home run) during an 11-8 win over the Detroit Tigers on July 29th. The bases-loaded-round-tripper tied the Red Sox slugger for 2nd place with Babe Ruth and moved him within six of the all-time leader, Lou Gehrig.
In the National League...
Tragedy struck the Los Angeles Dodgers after catcher Roy Campanella was involved in a serious auto accident on Long Island. Although he survived suffering a broken neck, his spinal column was nearly severed and his legs were permanently paralyzed.
On May 11th, the St. Louis Cardinals set a National League record by using ten pinch hitters during a regulation double-header. Despite walking fourteen batters in game one, The ""Redbirds"" managed to top the Chicago Cubs 8-7 and followed in game two with another 6-5 win. Despite the lengthy line-up, Stan Musial remained the Cardinals biggest threat at the plate and posted a home run and four singles to come within two hits of three-thousand. Amazingly, the Cards would tie their own record two months later against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 13th.
Milwaukee Braves ace Warren Spahn became the first lefty to win twenty or more games, nine times, after beating the St. Louis Cardinals 8-2 on September 13th. (Eddie Plank and Lefty Grove, each won twenty games, eight times).
Around the League...
Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick announced that the players and coaches (rather than the fans) would elect their line-ups for the All-Star Game.
""Teddy Ballgame"" aka Ted Williams, signed a whopping $135,000 contract extension with the Boston Red Sox making him the highest paid player (to date) in the history of Major League Baseball. Later that season he became only the 10th player ever to get one-thousand extra-base hits.
Decades before the premiere of ESPN or the YES Network, the New York Yankees announced that they would televise an unprecedented one-hundred forty games during the 1958 season. The Philadelphia Phillies followed several days later agreeing to broadcast seventy-eight games in the New York City area.
Starting this season, all American League hitters were required to wear batting helmets.
""Let's keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn, So send the Phils to Trenton, the Giants to St. Paul, but keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn, the greatest borough of all."" - Phil Foster

On September 13, 1958, Warren Spahn of the Milwaukee Braves won his 20th game of the season - the 9th time he joined the 20 Wins Club during his career and a new Major League benchmark for left-handed pitchers.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1959 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United States expanded its borders as both Alaska and Hawaii were officially admitted to the Union. Despite an overwhelming vote by Alaskans in 1956, it took more than two years for the Senate to finally agree to make Alaska the forty-ninth state. On March 18, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower added Hawaii, the Aloha State, and commissioned a new fifty star U.S. Flag.
Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson), and Ritchie Valens died when their Beechcraft plane crashed just outside Clear Lake, Iowa, during a stormy winter night. Holly was famous for many hits including ""Peggy Sue."" The Big Bopper had one big hit, ""Chantilly Lace."" And Valens was best known for his hit, ""La Bamba."" The tragic accident was penned in the papers as ""The Day the Music Died"".
Scandal rocked America's most popular Game Show ""Twenty-One"" after former champion Herbert Stempel confessed to being given the answers to questions, told which questions to miss, and coached in presentation. After he blew the whistle, public outrage was so great that in 1959 Congress opened hearings on the great American quiz show fix and later formally outlawed all future quiz show deceptions.
In the American League...
The Boston Red Sox remained as the only Major League team not to include minority players in its line-up. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a grievance against the franchise charging them with racial discrimination and calling for an official investigation into the team's signing policies.
Chicago White Sox second baseman Nellie Fox managed five hits in seven at bats on Opening Day (including a two-run home run off pitcher Don Mossi to win the game) during a fourteen-inning, 9-7 victory over the Detroit Tigers. His five hits in a season opener tied a Major League record that would not be matched for forty years.
Cleveland's Rocky Colavito hit four consecutive home runs at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium en route to an 11-8 victory over the home team Orioles. The Indian slugger joined Lou Gehrig and Bobby Lowe as the only Major League players ever to hit four consecutive round-trippers.
In the National League...
On May 26, Pirates ace Harvey Haddix pitched a perfect game against Milwaukee for twelve innings, only to lose in the 13th. After Felix Mantilla managed to reach base on a fielding error, Hank Aaron was intentionally walked. Pittsburgh's strategy proved meaningless though as Joe Adcock maintained the Braves newfound momentum with a three-run blast for the comeback win. The following day National League President Warren Giles ruled that the final score should be amended to 1-0, since both runners Henry Aaron and Joe Adcock were both ruled out. (Aaron had been called for leaving the field during play, and Adcock had passed him in the base path.)
Seven pitchers combined to tie a National League record with twenty-three strikeouts during a May 31 outing between the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. Sandy Koufax led the effort with nine ""K's"" for the 5-3 win.
The San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs set a new record for the longest nine-inning game in history after playing for three hours and fifty minutes. The home team finally won the ""marathon at Wrigley"" with a score of 20-9 after tallying nineteen hits and five home runs.
Around the League...
The Rules Committee finally permitted inter-league trading for a limited, three-and-a-half-week period during Major League Baseball's winter meetings.
The Players Association fired lawyer J. Norman Lewis and replaced him with Judge Robert C. Cannon, the son of Wisconsin Congressman Raymond J. Cannon, who had attempted to unionize the players during the 1920 season.
Controversy erupted over the American League batting title as the Cleveland Indians' Tito Francona finished the season with a league leading .363 average, but fell one at-bat short (three-hundred ninety-nine) of the required total (four-hundred). As a result, Harvey Kuenn of the Detroit Tigers was crowned the American League batting champion.
Washington D.C. Senator Estes Kefauver warned Major League Baseball that they were closely monitoring the ""attitudes of organized baseball"" toward the Continental League in an effort to prevent any antitrust issues.
""Harvey Kuenn gave it an honest pursuit, but the only center fielder in baseball who could have caught it hit it."" - Bob Stevens in the San Francisco Chronicle (July 8, 1959)

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1960 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The fifty-star Flag of the United States was officially dedicated on July 4. The newly expanded banner had been modified following the admission of the 50th state, Hawaii, on August 21, 1959 with an Executive Order filed by President Eisenhower providing the arrangement of nine rows of stars staggered horizontally and eleven rows staggered vertically.
President Eisenhower signed the Civil Rights Act of 1960 enabling federal judges to appoint referees to hear persons claiming that state election officials had denied minorities the right to register and vote. Though well intended, the statute proved ineffective, making it necessary for President Lyndon B. Johnson to persuade Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965.
John F. Kennedy, a first-ballot nominee, defeated Richard Nixon to become the youngest President ever elected in the United States. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President and immediately set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II.
In the American League...
On Opening Day, ""Teddy Baseball"" (Ted Williams) tied the ""Iron Horse"" (Lou Gehrig) with the 493rd home run of his career. The 500' blast in his first at-bat remained the only bright moment for Boston as the Washington Senators' Camilo Pascual struck out 11 Red Sox batters on the way to a 10-1 victory. Williams hit number 500 later that season with a 3-1 win over the Cleveland Indians on June 17.
American League Most Valuable Player Roger Maris debuted as a New York Yankee against the Boston Red Sox with 2 home runs and 4 RBIs en route to an 8-4 win at Fenway Park.
Baltimore Orioles catcher Clint Courtney became the first at his position to complete 2 career unassisted double plays during a 5-3 loss to the New York Yankees.
In the National League...
George Crowe of the St. Louis Cardinals hit four-pinch homers for a Major League career record of fourteen.
Baseball's greatest defensive player became baseball's greatest offensive player with a single at-bat during the Pittsburgh Pirates versus New York Yankees World Series. After being statistically dominated by their American League rivals for six outings, the National League champions found themselves with their backs against the wall at Forbes Field for Game 7. Stats mattered little in the end though as second baseman Bill Mazeroski stepped up to the plate (in the bottom of the ninth) and delivered a desperate, bases-empty home run for the 10-9 victory and the first Pirates World Championship in thirty-five years.
The Los Angeles Dodgers set an all-time National League record for attendance with 2,253,887 coming out to the Coliseum.
Around the League...
Bill Veeck became the first to break uniform tradition after putting the names of his players on the backs of their Chicago White Sox jerseys. In reaction, the rest of the league's teams sent formal protests to the commissioner's office demanding that the names be removed. After hearing both sides, it was determined that each team would have the option to add their names or stay with the traditional number only.
Television icon Gene Autry attended the annual American League owners meeting while investigating possible broadcasting opportunities. After realizing Autry's true respect for the game of baseball as well as his political connections in California, American League President Joe Cronin nominated him for ownership. The result was the birth of the California Angels expansion franchise.
The Sporting News named Boston Red Sox icon Ted Williams as their ""Player of the Decade"" for the 1950s.
The last remaining chapter in the Negro Leagues disbanded after a steady decline in talent due to the inclusion and rapid growth of African-American players in the Major Leagues.
""There wasn't any one thing (that caused him to resign after an Opening Day loss in 1960), just a lot of things. I'm forty-nine and I want to live to be fifty."" - Phillies Manager Eddie Sawyer

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1961 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
A new American based humanitarian organization called the ""Peace Corps"" was started at the insistence President John F. Kennedy. The program encouraged young people, most just out of college, to volunteer a year of their time to work as teachers, health care providers or other advisors for poor nations in Africa, Asia and South America.
The United States government pledged to increase its military presence to aid South Vietnam in the fight against the Viet Cong rebels. Although not ""officially engaged"" in a formal state of war, the new agreement provided increased funding for the Vietnamese army and more U.S. advisors in the field.
An unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government of Cuban premier Fidel Castro by United States-backed rebels took place in April. An invasion force consisting of approximately 1,500 Cuban exiles, armed with U.S. weapons, landed at the Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) on the south coast hoping to find support from the local population. Within hours, most were wiped out by Castro's own troops or taken prisoner for ransom. Acting President John F. Kennedy took full responsibility for the disaster, even though the plans had been put in place during the Eisenhower administration.
In the American League...
New York's newly crowned single-season home run champion Roger Maris beat out Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle by 4 votes for the American League Most Valuable Player Award.
On September 15, the New York Yankees also broke the all-time home run record (for a team) with 223 round-trippers. The combined franchise mark had been previously held by the 1947 New York Giants and the 1956 Cincinnati Reds.
Baltimore Orioles slugger Jim Gentile tied Ernie Banks' Major League record for most grand slams in a season after hitting his 5th off of the Chicago White Sox' Don Larsen.
In the National League...
On September 15, Los Angeles Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax set down 10 Milwaukee Braves bringing his season total to 243 — a National League record for left-handed pitchers. The New York Giants' Rube Marquard had held the National League lefty record previously after fanning 237 in 1911.
The San Francisco Giants set a new precedent for Major League salaries after signing Willie Mays to an $85,000 contract — the highest in their history and the most paid to any player in 1961.
The National League's newest franchise was officially christened as the ""Mets"" after New York fans were asked to vote on a list of finalists submitted by mail. Other names selected for the ballot included the ""Burros"", ""Skyliners"", ""Rebels"" and ""Skyscrapers"".
Around the League...
Political tensions between the United States and Cuba initially prevented all Cuban players, including Minnie Minoso of the Chicago White Sox and Camilo Pascual and Pedro Ramos of the Minnesota Twins, from returning to the U.S. for the 1961 season. After several negotiations, a high-ranking foreign ministry official finally permitted their unconditional return.
""The M&M Boys"" (Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris) became THE single most important story in the 1961 season as both New York Yankee teammates raced to beat Babe Ruth's single-season homerun record of sixty. After going head-to-head for several months, Mantle fell out of the race due to a serious hip infection that required hospitalization. Maris pressed on and finally topped ""The Bambino"" during the final game of the season with number 61 off Tracy Stallard of the Boston Red Sox. Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick ruled that Maris' record would be recorded with an asterisk in the books, making it a separate and distinctive record due to the new one-hundred sixty-two game schedule. Years later, acting Commissioner Fay Vincent reversed the ruling, ""removing the asterisk"" and recognizing Maris as an official record-breaker.
In response to the rash of home runs around the league, both American League President Joe Cronin and National League President Warren Giles agreed to order tests to determine if the ""1961 baseball"" was ""livelier"" than those of past seasons. The investigation conducted by technologists at Foster D. Snell Inc. concluded that the ball was slightly larger and several ounces lighter than the one used by Babe Ruth in the 1920s.
""When I'm not hitting, I don't hit nobody. But, when I'm hitting, I hit anybody."" - Willie Mays

On April 28, 1961, Warren Spahn of the Milwaukee Braves threw a 1-0 no-hitter versus the San Francisco Giants. Did you know that Spahn had turned forty on the April 23, 1961, making him the second oldest pitcher in Major League history to toss a gem?
On April 30, 1961, Joey Amalfitano's baseball bat joined a truly elite club when it was literally borrowed by Willie Mays who proceeded to slam four home runs during one game with his teammate's bat.
On June 10, 1961, Sandy ""The Scatter Arm"" Koufax reportedly got his control this season and the New York Times even published an article that stated he ""has zeroed in on home plate."" Koufax continued to respond throughout the season and appeared in his first All-Star Game, lead the league in strikeouts, and began a reign of dominance that lasted until his retirement in 1966.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1962 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
After hearing the case of Engel vs. Vitale, the Supreme Court ruled that state-sponsored prayer in schools was unconstitutional. Although prayer was not outlawed in school entirely (only school-sponsored prayer) the decision ignited a controversy that has continued unabated until today.
On February 20, 1962, astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. Flying aboard his spacecraft, Friendship Seven, the Marine Lieutenant travelled roughly 81,000 miles as he circled our planet three times at speeds greater than 17,000 mph.
In late August, American spy planes detected the building of military missile sites in Cuba. U.S. Intelligence sources later determined the Soviets, under Nikita Khrushchev, had decided to shorten the strategic gap between the two world powers by placing missiles there limiting America's warning capabilities if attacked. In October, President John F. Kennedy was presented with conclusive proof that the Soviets were in fact installing medium-range ballistic missiles. After several tense days of defensive posturing, the issue was peacefully resolved after the United States agreed not to invade Cuba, and the Soviets agreed to withdraw all military forces and weapons.
In the American League...
The Baltimore Orioles' Brooks Robinson became only the fifth player in Major League history to hit grand slams in back-to-back games after knocking out a bases loaded round-tripper on May 6th and May 9th.
After missing thirty games due to recurring knee injuries, New York's Mickey Mantle limped to the plate as a pinch hitter and launched a four-hundred twenty foot blast off of Gary Bell of the Cleveland Indians. The home team crowd showed their respects by giving the visiting Yankee a standing ovation.
Earl Wilson became the first black pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the American League as the Boston Red Sox topped the California Angels 2-0 on June 26th at Fenway Park. Wilson also dominated at the plate with a four-hundred foot homer off Bo Belinsky who had tossed a ""no-no"" of his own in his last start against the Baltimore Orioles.
In the National League...
On February 1, 1962, the National League released its first 162-game schedule, including a record 421 scheduled night games, up from 318 in 1961.
The Houston Colt 45s, one of the National Leagues two new teams (New York Mets), opened with an impressive 11-2 triumph over the Chicago Cubs before a crowd of over 25,000. Roman Mejias set the pace with two, three-run home runs and Hal Smith followed close behind debuting with a round-tripper of his own.
Stan Musial set a National League record (previously held by Mel Ott) after scoring for the 1,806th time in his career during a St. Louis Cardinals win over the Chicago Cubs on April 13th. Later in the season Musial became the leagues all-time leader in total bases with 5,864 during a June 22nd outing against the Philadelphia Phillies.
On September 7th, Los Angeles Dodger Maury Wills stole four bases off the Pittsburgh Pirates setting a National League record for eighty-two ""robberies"" in a single season.
Around the League...
John ""Buck"" O'Neil became the first African-American coach in Major League baseball after joining the staff of the Chicago Cubs. O'Neil had been a scout for the Cubs organization previously and was credited with discovering both Ernie Banks and Lou Brock.
Baseball's newest franchise, the New York Mets, debuted in what some referred to as ""copycat uniforms"" that featured Dodger blue sleeves, Giants orange lettering and Yankee pinstripes. Unfortunately the Mets played as bad as they looked and finished their inaugural season with a laughable 40-120 record.
After several years of ""double-headers"", both players and owners agreed to return the All-Star Game to its original, one-game format in 1963.
Kansas City owner Charles Finley hired the first woman in baseball broadcasting. Betty Caywood was brought in initially to do ""color-commentary"" for the A's games, but later became the first female to regularly announce baseball games while airing her reports from both the dugout and the stands.
""When I go back in my mind to our play in 1962, I just wonder how we ever got to win 40 games."" - New York Mets manager Casey Stengel

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1963 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Minister and civil-rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King led over two hundred thousand people in the largest non-violent demonstration ever held to support the passage of civil rights legislation. The historic march on Washington D.C. was highlighted by King's infamous ""I have a dream"" speech in which he stated ""one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: we hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal.""
On November 22nd, President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed as he rode through the streets of Dallas, Texas aboard the presidential motorcade. Lee Harvey Oswald was later identified as the lone assassin although his guilt was never proven in a court of law. While in police custody, Oswald himself was shot and killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.
As a first step toward ending the ""Cold War"", a test ban agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union was ratified by the Senate on October 10. The contract between the world's two superpowers prohibited any future above ground testing of nuclear weapons of mass destruction.
In the American League...
Detroit Tiger Billy Bruton tied a Major League record for most doubles in a single game after hitting four straight to top the Washington Senators 5-1 on May 19th. Teammate and rookie pitcher Bill Faul matched Bruton's efforts on the mound while tossing a three hitter in his first Major League start.
On May 22nd, Mickey Mantle hit what is considered by many experts to be the longest homerun in Major League history. Batting left-handed against the visiting Kansas City A's at Yankee Stadium, Mantle opened the eleventh inning with a monumental blast off Bill Fisher that traveled three-hundred seventy-four feet from home plate, bouncing off of the third tier facade and falling just inches short of going out of the stadium. A senior physicist from the University of Arizona, Professor J.E. McDonald, calculated the estimated distance the ball would have traveled at six-hundred twenty feet.
Cleveland pitcher Early Wynn finally won his 300th (and final) game thanks to a little help from the Indian's bullpen. After losing eight straight and struggling through five innings during the second half of a Kansas City doubleheader, Wynn was replaced by relief man Jerry Walker who tossed four scoreless sides en route to a 7-4 win over the Athletics.
In the National League...
Chicago Cubs first baseman Ernie Banks became the first National League player to tally twenty-two putouts (and twenty-three chances) in a game, during a May 9th, 3-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.
On June 15th, Juan Marichal set two records after becoming the first Latin American pitcher AND only the second Giant (Carl Hubbell, 1929) to pitch a no-hitter during a 1-0 triumph over the Houston Colt 45s (Astros) at Candlestick Park.
Milwaukee Brave veteran Warren Spahn topped the National League record for most starts (previously held by Grover Alexander) with his 601st appearance on the mound during a 6-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 23rd. Later in the season Spahn tied Christy Mathewson's National League record with his thirteenth, twenty-win season and became the oldest to do so at age forty-two.
Around the League...
The Major League Rules Committee voted to expand the strike zone, extending it from the top of the shoulders to the bottom of the knees restoring its original pre-1950 specifications.
On September 6th, Major League Baseball celebrated its 100,000th game with a classic match-up between the Cleveland Indians and Washington Senators at D.C. Stadium.
St. Louis Cardinals' slugger Stan Musial made a record 24th All-Star Game appearance as his National League teammates combined to beat their American League counterparts 5-3 in the Midsummer Classic.
Houston Colt 45s (Astros) manager Harry Craft shocked the New York Mets after starting an all-rookie line-up during a September 27th contest. Fifteen rookies appeared in all, but were bested by the older and wiser Mets who ""mentored"" them with a 10-3 lesson in experience.
""That way I can see where I've been (on why he ran around the bases facing backwards after hitting his 100th career home run). I always know where I'm going."" - Piersall, Jimmy. Post Game Press Conference. 23 June 1963.

On April 11, 1963, it all started with a triple - that particular triple was the first hit for future Hit King Pete Rose and the pitcher who served it up was Bob Friend of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
The extremely high temperatures in Houston, Texas set the stage for the first ever Sunday night game. The historic event took place on June 9, 1963, at Colt Stadium where the Houston Colt .45s defeated the San Francisco Giants 3-0.
Several trivia experts know that when Felipe Alou, Jesus Alou, and Matty Alou appeared in the San Francisco Giants outfield together on September 6, 1963, it was a Major League first. However, did you know that 4 days later they set an even more unique record when they became the first trio of brothers to record all three outs during the same inning (8th inning versus the New York Mets).

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1964 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
On February 9th, the British rock group The Beatles arrived in America for an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was the ""Fab 4's"" first trip to the United States and introduced their unique sound and stylish appearance to millions of American teenagers. By the week of April 4th, The Beatles had taken over the radio airways and held the top five slots on the American pop charts.
The highly contested and still criticized Warren Commission delivered its final report on September 27th concluding that President John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, had acted alone and on his own recourse.
American's first computer dynasty International Business Machines (also known as IBM) introduced the first 360 Computer, which was defined as a second-generation system based on transistors. The groundbreaking machine was instantly heralded as a huge success and became the standard for computers of many businesses for many years.
In the American League...
Mickey Mantle set the tenth Major League record of his career after hitting two ""switch"" home runs in a single game against the Chicago White Sox. Mantle's first shot off Ray Herbert (a left-handed effort) traveled 461 feet and finally stopped 502 feet from the plate. Later in the game, ""The Mick"" added a second round-tripper (swinging right-handed) that guaranteed rookie pitcher Mel Stottlemyre's 7-3 debut victory.
Decades before the ""Roberto Alomar incident"" Golden Glove first baseman Vic Power of the California Angels was suspended for ten days and fined $250 after spitting on umpire Jim Honochick during a doubleheader loss to the Chicago White Sox.
Kansas City A's rookie Bert Campaneris became only the second player (Bob Nieman) since 1900 to hit two home runs in his Major League debut during a 4-3 win over Jim Kaat and the Minnesota Twins. He also set the mark as the first American League player ever to knock one out on the first pitch thrown to him. Bill Roman of the Detroit Tigers equaled the feat later in the season during a 7-6, loss to the New York Yankees for his first (and last) career home run.
In the National League...
Willie Mays became the first African-American player to hold the ""team leader title"" after San Francisco Giants' skipper Alvin Dark named him as the team's captain.
On April 6th, ""Shea Stadium"" was officially dedicated as the New York Mets ballpark. The $25 million dollar facility was named after William A. Shea who christened baseball's newest cathedral by pouring a mixture of water from the Harlem River (near the old Polo Grounds) and the Gowanus Canal (near the site of Ebbets Field) over the infield in a pre-game ceremony.
The St. Louis Cardinals became only the second team in the modern era (1923 Giants) to score at least one run in every inning while rolling over the Chicago Cubs during a September 13th outing at Wrigley Field. ""Redbirds"" Lou Brock and Julian Javier led the rally with one homer each and Curt Simmons topped Dick Ellsworth on the mound for the 15-2 win.
Around the League...
Subscription television for baseball games debuted on July 17th as the first pay cablecast (a night game between the LA Dodgers and Chicago Cubs) was broadcasted live from Los Angeles. The home team emerged as 3-2 winners thanks to the solid arm of Don Drysdale who sat down ten batters.
The National League avoided an umpires' strike by agreeing with the officials on a new five-year contract that increased both pensions and insurance payments.
After an eleven year stint in Milwaukee, the Braves Board of Directors unanimously voted to request permission from the National League to move the struggling franchise to Atlanta. Milwaukee County officials immediately sued to block the move despite the team's faltering attendance of 800,000 for the past two seasons. In November, the league ordered the Braves to stay put in Milwaukee for the upcoming season, but permitted a move to Atlanta in 1966.
Major League Baseball finally approved a free-agent draft system that mimicked the one used in professional football. Order of selection was determined in reverse order of each club's previous season standings and all draftees were to be included on the forty man roster. They also restored all powers rescinded after Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis's death in 1944 to the baseball commissioner's office. The decision waived all owners' rights to take legal action in the event of disagreements and granted the commissioner total authority to judge whether actions taken by a team and/or owner were in the best interests of the game.

On April 23, 1964, Ken Johnson of the Houston Colt .45s had no luck going his way when he pitched nine no-hit innings versus the Cincinnati Reds, but lost the game 0-1.
What major event took place in 1964 that had not occurred during a regular season game in more than 40 years? A perfect game and it was tossed on Father's Day (June 21, 1964) by Jim Bunning.
On September 13, 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals scored at least one run during every inning to become the sixth National League team to record such a feat - a feat that is listed in its entirety in our Record Books section.

Off the field...
Controversial civil rights activist Malcolm Little, also known as ""Malcolm X"", was assassinated while delivering a speech at the OAAU rally in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem on February 21st. The Islamic minister had become an inspirational leader alongside Dr. Martin Luther King after breaking ties with the Nation of Islam in order to create his own religious community known as Muslim Mosque, Inc., and later the Organization of Afro-American Unity.
A routine traffic stop and arrest for drunk driving in South Central Los Angeles lit the fire for what would become known as the Watts Riots. In response to the police action, many residents accused the law of practicing racial bias and erupted violently for six days leaving thirty-four dead, over a thousand people injured, nearly four-thousand arrested, and hundreds of buildings destroyed.
Construction on the nation's tallest memorial, the Gateway Arch, was finally completed after a four-year span. The six-hundred thirty feet high, stainless steel structure was originally designed by architect Eero Saarinen in 1947 for the Expansion Memorial Park which was established on the banks of the Mississippi River to commemorate the westward growth of the United States.
In the American League...
New York Yankees ace Mel Stottlemyre became the first pitcher in fifty-five years to hit an inside-the-park home run during a 6-3 win over their American League rivals, the Boston Red Sox, on July 20th.
Bert Campaneris, of the Kansas City Athletics, set an unprecedented Major League record by playing all nine positions during a September 8th outing against the California Angels. Campaneris allowed just one run (on a hit) and two walks while on the mound, but went 0-for-3 at the plate. Despite the ""one man show"" the Angels went on to win it, 5-3 after thirteen innings.
Shortstop Ron Hanson of the Chicago White Sox tied a Major League record with twenty-eight fielding chances during a double-header against the Boston Red Sox. Hanson handled eighteen shots in the first contest, setting an American League record, and ten more in the nightcap. Chicago, like their shortstop, came out on top in both games with matching 3-2 victories.
In the National League...
On April 9th, the $31 million dollar, ultramodern indoor ballpark known as the ""Astrodome"" debuted with an exhibition game between the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Texas Governor John Connally were among the 47,000+ plus fans who witnessed the first ever, indoor home run courtesy of Mickey Mantle.
Chicago ""Cubbie"" Ernie Banks slugged his four-hundredth career homer during a 5-3 triumph over Curt Simmons and the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field.
San Francisco slugger Willie Mays became the fifth member of the ultra-exclusive ""500 Home Runs Club"" after paying the membership dues off Don Nottebart during a 5-1 Giants victory over the Houston Astros at the Astrodome.
Around the League...
Baseball's first free-agent draft was held at the Hotel Commodore in New York City resulting in three-hundred twenty players being selected by twenty Major League teams. It was later determined that the draft would continue to take place every June and January with teams selecting prospects in the reverse order of the league standings.
One of baseball's greatest left-handed aces, Warren Spahn announced his retirement after an amazing twenty-one seasons. Spahn walked away from the game with a 363-245 career record and a lifetime ERA of 3.09. He also ranked as number six on the all-time list with sixty-three shutouts and thirteen, twenty-win seasons.
On December 9th, Branch Rickey, the man who helped Jackie Robinson break through baseball's color barrier by signing him with the Brooklyn Dodgers, died at the age of eighty-three.
Los Angeles Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax became the first two-time recipient of the Cy Young Award. Unfortunately, he would manage only one more season (where he became the first three-time recipient) before retiring with an astounding 165-87 record over a twelve year period.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1966 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
After murdering both his wife and mother, serial sniper Charles Whitman ascended to the observation deck at Austin's University of Texas tower killing fourteen people and injuring thirty-one others during a ninety-minute shooting spree. He was eventually shot and killed himself after a civilian and two police officers stormed the tower and overpowered him.
Media icon Walt Disney, who turned the whimsical cartoon world of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck into a million dollar a year entertainment empire, died of cancer at the age of sixty-five. The pioneering animator had produced the first fully animated motion picture and had invented the original concept of theme parks with his final masterpiece, Disneyland in California.
The first U.S. manned space flights, Gemini 8 thru 12, were launched in preparation for man's eventual trip to the moon. Following the pioneering Mercury program and preceding the Apollo missions, Gemini flights were specifically developed to learn how to maneuver a spacecraft into orbit and rendezvous with other docking vehicles.
In the American League...
On July 29th, Mickey Mantle hit his four-hundred ninety-fourth homerun off of Chicago White Sox ace Bruce Howard moving himself ahead of fellow Yankee Lou Gehrig for sixth place on the all-time list. Teammate Al Downing sweetened the deal with a clutch 2-1 performance on the mound.
Baltimore Orioles slugger ""Boog"" Powell astonished the crowd at Fenway Park after hitting not one, not two, but three, opposite-field homers OVER the ""Green Monster"" on the way to a 4-3, victory in which he totaled thirteen bases himself. Powell would also go on to become the first player ever to appear in the Little League World Series as well as the Major League version.
Teammate Frank Robinson was unanimously voted as the American League MVP becoming the first player to win the title in both the American and National Leagues since the Baseball Writers Association took it over in 1931. Robinson, who also won the American League Triple Crown, was also voted most valuable player in 1961 as a member of the Cincinnati Reds.
In the National League...
Tony Cloninger, of the recently transplanted Atlanta Braves, became the first National League pitcher to ever hit two grand-slams in a single game during a July 3rd, 17-3 triumph over the San Francisco Giants. Cloninger's first slam came off of rival pitcher Bob Priddy in the first, and then in the fourth he added another off of Ray Sadecki.
Willie Mays moved up to #2 (behind Babe Ruth) on the all-time list with his five-hundred thirty-fifth career home run, off of Ray Washburn, as the San Francisco Giants topped the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3 on August 17th.
On October 2nd, Sandy Koufax tallied his last Major League victory with a 6-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies for the National League pennant. The Los Angeles Dodgers ace completed his twelve-year career with an amazing 165-87 record with a 2.76 ERA, forty shutouts and two-thousand three-hundred ninety-six strikeouts. Koufax also held the National League single-season strikeout record with three-hundred eighty-two K's (1965) and compiled an astounding 0.95 ERA in seven World Series starts.
Around the League...
Major League Baseball's first African-American umpire, Emmett Ashford made his debut on Opening Day as the American League's Washington Senators lost to the visiting Cleveland Indians 5-2.
Ted Williams used a portion of his Hall of Fame induction speech to plead for the inclusion of Negro League players including Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
The infield at Houston's Astrodome became the first to be replaced by the new experimental surface known as ""Astroturf"". In the first game ever to be played on the artificial grass, the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers prevailed over the home team 6-3.
Dan Topping sold his remaining shares of interest in the New York Yankees to the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) for a reported $1.4 million dollars. In the end, the television dynasty paid a total of $14 million for total control of the franchise. Topping initially looked to come out on top in the deal as three days later, only four-hundred thirteen fans showed up at Yankee Stadium for a game against the Chicago White Sox.
""You know, I never had a cross word with anybody in 15 years in Milwaukee. Everybody had fun. We'd get to the park 2 or 3 hours early, sit around 2 or 3 hours after the game. Boy, that was enjoyable."" - Eddie Mathews

1966 NL Team Pitching Stats
On April 12, 1966, baseball made its debut in Atlanta, Georgia when the Milwaukee Braves moved their ""home"" to Fulton County Stadium. Nearly a quarter-million fans watch the pre-game parade and 50,671 fans attended the inaugural game where the Pirates won 3-2 on a 13th inning Willie Stargell home run.
On April 24, 1966, Willie Mays tied Mel Ott for the National League record for career home runs when he hit his 511th long ball. On May 4, 1966, Claude Osteen of the Dodgers served up the record breaker and Mays stood at the top of the senior circuit.
On October 2, 1966, one of the most dominant pitchers of the era recorded his final victory. Sandy Koufax won his 27th of the season and captured the Dodgers second consecutive pennant before hanging up his spikes at the top of his career. Asked why he chose to leave the game at this moment he replied, ""I've got a lot of years to live after baseball and I would like to live them with the complete use of my body.""

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1979 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The construction of nuclear power plants in the United States temporarily came to a halt after a nuclear accident occurred at the Three Mile Island facility near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After several tense days of emergency cleanup, the leak was completely contained, but raised the concern about the safety of people living near such volatile energy sources. After a media frenzy erupted, the facility was toured by President Jimmy Carter in an effort to calm the panic stricken public.
On July 26th, U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the Trade Act Bill in response to trade negotiations with Tokyo. The bill reduced further tariffs on a wide range of items, and introduced a new policy to handle unfair trade practices.
Militant Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Teheran (taking fifty-two Americans hostage) in protest after the Ayatollah Khomeini overthrew the Shah of Iran. The hostages were subjected to four-hundred forty-four days of brutal conditions amidst repeated negotiation failures. A rescue attempt called ""Operation Desert One"" was aborted in the Iranian desert the following year resulting in the deaths of eight Americans.
In the American League...
On April 5th, the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox 5-3 giving Earl Weaver his one-thousandth career win as a Major League skipper.
Thurman Munson, the team captain of the New York Yankees, died when the Cessna Citation twin-engine jet he was piloting crashed outside of Canton, Ohio two-hundred feet short of the Akron Airport runway. The thirty-two year-old catcher was a three-time Golden Glove winner, the 1976 American League MVP and a seven-time All-Star. His lifetime batting average was .292 and included an incredible .529 average in the 1976 World Series.
On July 24th, Red Sox sensation Carl Yastrzemski hit his four-hundredth career home run off of the Oakland A's Mike Morgan at Fenway Park. On September 12th, ""The Yaz"" totaled his three-thousandth hit becoming the first American League player to tally both numbers.
In the National League...
St. Louis Cardinal Gary Templeton became the first player in Major League history to have one-hundred hits from each side of the plate in the same season. The switch hitter batted strictly right-handed in his last nine games to aid his own cause in setting the record.
Pete Rose, then with the Philadelphia Phillies, totaled over two-hundred hits for the tenth season in his career breaking Ty Cobb's record of nine years.
Willie Stargell hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning of Game 7 to push the Pittsburgh Pirates ahead for good in a 4-1 World Series victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The championship title capped off a Cinderella season in which ""Pops"" and his ""Family"" brought fun back to baseball.
Around the League...
On May 17th, the forty-five day umpires strike concluded after fourteen hours of negotiation. The official's new agreement included a pay increase of approximately $7,000, a heightened cap on maximum salaries from $40,000 to $50,000, two weeks of vacation during the regular season and improved pension benefits. One controversial issue remained though as the league presidents voted to add some of the replacement umpires to the regular roster.
WLUP-FM's promotional ""Disco Demolition Night"" at Chicago's Comiskey Park went terribly wrong as 50,000 fans turned up to receive a $.98 ticket for the doubleheader with records and eventually rioted on the field. After a delay of one hour and sixteen minutes, the umpires determined that the field was unplayable and called the second game between the White Sox and visiting Detroit Tigers. The following day, American League President Lee MacPhail awarded the Tigers a 9-0 forfeit win.
Walter O'Malley, the man who moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, died at the Mayo Clinic on August 9th at the age of seventy-five. The team's still acting Chairman of the Board was still considered a sellout in New York and was quoted as saying that, ""Baseball wasn't a business, but more like a disease.""
Writer Daniel Okrent drew up the first set of official rules for a new pastime based on the actual day-to-day statistical play of real major leaguers. The ""rotisserie league"" would eventually evolve into the phenomenon known as ""Fantasy Baseball"".
""The 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates, emphasizing the team concept to the point that they thought of themselves as a family (and even adopted a popular disco record as their theme song), parlayed their togetherness into a World Series championship. And, fittingly enough, a fellow known affectionately as 'Pops' was the big man in this family."" - The Sporting News

On April 16, 1978, Bob Forsch pitched a no-hit game for the St. Louis Cardinals. On April 7, 1979, Ken Forsch of the Astros struck out 5, issued 2 bases on balls, and did not allow a single Brave to get a hit making the Forsch brothers the first in Major League history to toss no-hitters.
On June 24, 1977, Bob Watson hit for the cycle with the Houston Astros. On September 15, 1978, Watson hit for the cycle with the Red Sox making him the first Major League player to complete the cycle in each modern league.
Pete Rose finished the 1979 season with 208 hits - the tenth time in his career where he surpassed the 200 hit plateau. However, did you know that Rose also became the first player in history to accomplish that hitting feat (Ty Cobb was the closest and he did it 9 times)?

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1980 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Former Beatle John Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman who opened fire outside the musician's New York City apartment. The forty-year-old was hit several times as he entered the Dakota, his luxury apartment building on Manhattan's Upper West Side, opposite Central Park. He was later rushed in a police car to St Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he died of four gunshot wounds to the back. Chapman, a disturbed individual who identified with Holden Caulfield, the irked hero of J.D. Salinger's cult novel ""Catcher in the Rye"" still remains in jail to this day.
Eighty-seven million American TV viewers wondered ""Who Shot J.R.?"" as America's hottest prime-time series, a slick soap opera depicting the private lives and public connivances of the somewhat dysfunctional, oil-rich Ewing family ended with one of the most shocking season finales ever produced on television. Eight months later the show earned the second largest audience share in television history with a record 53.3 rating. The final tally: forty-one million of the nearly seventy-eight million households in the U.S. tuned in and the answer was...
A failed U.S. military rescue mission called ""Operation Desert One"" was attempted several months after Shiite Muslim militants had attacked and seized the Embassy in Teheran, taking fifty-two Americans hostage. The attack upon the American Embassy occurred after the Shah of Iran was overthrown and power was seized by the Ayatollah Khomeini. The American hostages were subjected to four-hundred forty-four days of brutal conditions including mock executions and unfortunately their rescue attempt (ordered by President Jimmy Carter) failed miserably in the Iranian desert resulting in the deaths of eight Americans.
In the American League...
Both Dwayne Murphy and Rickey Henderson stole home in the first inning of an Oakland 'A's 6-3 win over the Kansas City Royals to tie a Major League record originally set in the American League by the Minnesota Twins (1969) and in the National League by St. Louis Cardinals (1925).
The Cleveland Indians tied a Major League record on June 1st after hitting four sacrifice flies in a single game thanks to Ron Hassey, Dave Rosello, Gary Alexander, and Dell Alston. Despite their selfless efforts, the Indians went on to lose 8-7 to the Seattle Mariners.
Despite missing forty-five games with injuries, George Brett was named the American League's Most Valuable Player. The twenty-seven year-old third baseman's .390 average was the highest in the Major Leagues since the Boston Red Sox's Ted Williams' .406 in 1941. He also added twenty-four home runs and one-hundred eighteen RBIs to lead the Kansas City Royals to their first American League pennant.
In the National League...
The Cincinnati Reds' Cesar Geronimo experienced déjà vu at the plate, as he became the three-thousandth career strikeout of the Houston Astros' Nolan Ryan. Ironically, he was also Bob Gibson's three-thousandth career strikeout victim six seasons earlier.
Pitcher Steve Carlton, then with the Philadelphia Phillies, fanned 7 St. Louis Cardinals in a July 6th, 8-3 win, crowning him as the major leagues' left-handed strikeout king with 2,836 K's.
Ron LeFlore, of the Montreal Expos, stole his sixty-second base on July 28th, during the seventh inning of a 5-4 win against the Cincinnati Reds, but was tagged out after stepping off the bag while trying to read the scoreboard that was noting the first stolen base occurrence one-hundred fifteen years earlier.
Around the league...
Henry Aaron refused an award from Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn honoring him for hitting his 715th home run in protest of Major League Baseball's treatment of retired black ballplayers.
The National Labor Relations Board ruled in favor of the umpires' union after they demanded that the National League release its umpire evaluations, particularly those of the replacement officials who were retained after filling in for striking umps in 1979.
On May 23rd, five hours after the midnight deadline passed, the players and owners averted a strike by announcing a new four-year basic agreement. The new deal raised the minimum player's salary from $21,000 to $30,000 and increased the clubs' contributions to the players' pension fund.
On August 20th, Pittsburgh Pirate centerfielder Omar Moreno stole his seventieth base of the season off the Houston Astros, becoming the first player in the 20th century with three consecutive seventy-steal seasons. Moreno swiped seventy-one in 1978, seventy-seven in 1979, and finished 1980 with a career-high ninety-six.
""We (ex-Brooklyn Dodgers) wept when they tore down Ebbets Field. They tore down a little piece of me."" - Duke Snider at his HOF induction on August 3, 1980

On April 9, 1980, George Foster of the Cincinnati Reds became the first Major League player to be credited with the newly formed game winning RBI statistic when he hit a two run homer off Phil Niekro of the Atlanta Braves.
On May 3, 1980, legendary slugger Willie McCovey hit the final home run of his career. The blast was McCovey's 521st and the victim was Scott Sanderson of the Montreal Expos.
On July 4, 1980, Nolan Ryan struck out Cesar Geronimo during the second inning to become only the fourth member of the 3,000 Strikeouts Club. TRIVIA ALERT: Why did Geronimo once say, ""I was just in the right place at the right time.""? Because he was also Bob Gibson's 3,000th strikeout victim in 1974.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1981 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Pope John Paul II was shot in an assassination attempt by Turkish-born Mehmet Ali Agca. Although wounded badly, he made a quick recovery and soon thereafter resumed his regular travel schedule. The attack gave birth to the infamous ""Pope Mobile,"" a modified Range Rover with the back converted to a large box made of bullet-proof glass which allowed him to ride along, but also stand up and wave to the crowds.
On March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan was shot and seriously wounded by lone gunman John Hinckley Jr., who claimed his motive was to impress actress Jodie Foster. While President Reagan made a full recovery, his press secretary, Jim Brady, suffered a gunshot wound to the head, leaving him partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. Brady remained a powerful advocate for gun control until his passing in 2014 at the age of 73. Hinckley was initially committed to a mental institution and later released from all court restrictions in 2022.
Sandra Day O'Connor was sworn in as the first female judge on the Supreme Court after being nominated by President Reagan. The courts 102nd appointee served as an Arizona assistant attorney general from 1965 to 1969, when she was appointed to a vacancy in the Arizona Senate. In 1974, she ran successfully for trial judge, a position she held until she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979.
In the American League...
In the first game of an April 19th doubleheader, the Oakland Athletics set a Major League mark for most consecutive wins at the start of the season after running their record to 11-0 with a 6-1 win over the Seattle Mariners.
On Friday, May 15th, Cleveland Indians pitcher Len Barker (the 1980 American League strikeout leader) fanned eleven batters on the way to a 3-0 triumph over the Toronto Blue Jays for the ninth perfect game in 20th century history.
The Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers became the first relief pitcher ever to win the American League MVP Award, edging the Oakland A's Rickey Henderson 319-308. The lanky right-hander with the handlebar mustache went on to become one of the greatest relief artists in all of baseball, lasting seventeen years and compiling the record for most career saves (three-hundred forty-five) as well as World Series saves (seven).
In the National League...
Philadelphia ace Steve Carlton struck out the side (Tim Raines, Jerry Manuel, and Tim Wallach) in the first inning of a 6-2 Phillies victory over the Montreal Expos on April 29th to become the first lefthander in Major League history (and sixth pitcher overall) to record three-thousand career strikeouts.
Los Angeles Dodgers ace Fernando Valenzuela became the first rookie ever to win a Cy Young Award after edging the Cincinnati Reds Tom Seaver 70-67 for National League honors. He also became the first rookie since the Cleveland Indians' Herb Score in 1955 to lead his league in strikeouts with one-hundred eighty.
Phillies third baseman Mike Schmidt won his second consecutive National League MVP Award, joining Ernie Banks and Joe Morgan as the only National League players to win the citation back-to-back. The perennial Philadelphia All-Star hit .316 with thirty-one home runs and added ninety-one RBIs despite the abbreviated season.
Around the league...
The Executive Board of the Players' Association voted unanimously to strike on May 29th due to the unresolved issue of free-agent compensation. The deadline was extended briefly, however, after the Players' Association's unfair labor complaint was heard by the National Labor Relations Board.
At 12:30 a.m. on June 12, union chief Marvin Miller officially announced the start of a players' strike, marking the longest labor dispute in American sports history. By the time the season resumed on August 10, a staggering 712 games—accounting for 34% of the Major League schedule—had been canceled.
Due to the two-month strike, Major League owners elected to split the 1981 season into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division meeting in a best-of-five divisional playoff series. As a result, the Oakland A's, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, and Los Angeles Dodgers were guaranteed playoff spots as first-half league champions.
Seattle Mariners manager Maury Wills was suspended for two games after ordering the grounds crew to enlarge the batter's boxes by one foot prior to its game with the Oakland Athletics. The request was in response to the A's complaint that Seattle's Tom Paciorek frequently stepped out of the box while hitting.
""He (Bob Gibson) told me to get back behind the batter (at the catcher's position). That the only thing I knew about pitching was that it was hard to hit."" - Teammate / Catcher Tim McCarver at Bob Gibson's HOF Induction on August 2, 1981

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1982 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Vietnam Veterans' War memorial was dedicated in Washington, bearing 58,000 names of US servicemen and women who were killed during one of America's most unpopular wars. ""The Wall"" was designed by Maya Ying Lin, an architecture student at Yale University and has become one of the most revered and appreciated public memorials in the United States.
Princess Grace of Monaco, a former Hollywood actress, was killed in a terrible accident after her car careened off the winding roads of France leading to Monaco. An investigation later revealed that she had suffered a mild stroke, which caused her to lose control of her vehicle.
Barney B. Clark made medical history when, at 61 years old, he became the first person to receive the ""Jarvik 7,"" the world's first permanent artificial heart. The groundbreaking procedure, performed by Dr. William C. DeVries at the University of Utah Medical Center, marked a bold step forward in the field of cardiac science. Clark fought valiantly, living for 112 days with the artificial heart before ultimately succumbing to complications. His courage and the pioneering transplant paved the way for future advancements in life-saving heart technology.
In the American League...
During an inter-league exhibition game between the Oakland Athletics and the San Diego Padres, A's pitcher Steve McCatty stepped up to the plate swinging a children's toy bat on the instructions of manager Billy Martin, who was upset that his club was not allowed to use a DH in spring training games at National League ballparks. Jim Quick, the home plate umpire, refused to allow the 15"" bat and McCatty was called out on three strikes.
The largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in the state of Minnesota (52,279) turned out for the inaugural game at the brand-new indoor Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The Seattle Mariners put a damper on the festivities though after beating the Twins 11-7.
The Detroit Tigers' Larry Herndon hit three home runs in an 11-9 win over the Oakland Athletics (following a round-tripper in his final at bat against the Minnesota Twins) to become the fourteenth player in Major League history to hit four home runs in consecutive plate appearances.
In the National League...
On Saturday, July 31st, Philadelphia Phillies second baseman Manny Trillo misplayed a Bill Buckner grounder in the seventh during a 2-0 win over the Chicago Cubs. The error ended Trillo's ""e-free"" streak at eighty-nine games and four-hundred seventy-nine consecutive chances stopping him just two games short of Joe Morgan's record of ninety-one.
On August 4th, Joel Youngblood became the first Major League player to play for two different teams in two different cities on the same day. The New York Mets outfielder started the afternoon by going one-for-two off the Cubs' Fergie Jenkins at Wrigley Field. Following the contest he was traded to the Montreal Expos and flew to Philadelphia in time to enter the sixth inning of a night game at Veterans Stadium. The well-traveled outfielder then went one-for-one off Steve Carlton, another Hall of Fame inductee, in a 5-4 loss.
Veteran first baseman Willie Stargell's number eight (8) was officially retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 6th, better known as ""Willie Stargell Day"" at Three Rivers Stadium. ""Pops"" twice led the National League in home runs, with a career high forty-eight in 1971 and his four-hundred seventy-five home runs were fifteenth all-time when he retired following the season. After his playing career, he went on to coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1985, and the Atlanta Braves from 1986-88.
Around the league...
Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson became the twelfth and thirteenth players elected to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA in their first year of eligibility. Aaron fell just nine votes shy of becoming the first-ever unanimous selection and his 97.8 election percentage was second only to Ty Cobb's 98.2 percent in the Hall's 1936 inaugural election.
Thirty-seven year-old Steve Carlton won the National League Cy Young Award for the fourth time, a record unmatched by any pitcher in the history of the Major Leagues through this date. The Philadelphia Phillies veteran lefthander led the National League in wins (twenty-three), innings (295.2), strikeouts (two-hundred eighty-six), and shutouts (six). He was a previous winner in 1972, 1977, as well as 1980.
An up-and-coming shortstop / third baseman named Cal Ripken, Jr. finished his debut season with a .264 average as well as twenty-eight home runs for the Baltimore Orioles and was named American League Rookie of the Year.
At a November Major League owners meeting in Chicago, members voted not to renew Commissioner Bowie Kuhn's contract, which was due to expire in August. The American League owners voted in favor of Kuhn 11-3 and the National League 7-5, but the eighteen votes left him two shy of the three-fourths majority required for reelection.
""I should make it (Ty Cobb's all-time hits record) sometime before the All-Star Game in 1984."" - Pete Rose on June 22, 1982 (moments after moving past Hank Aaron for second place all-time)

On May 25, 1982, Cubs' pitcher Fergie Jenkins became the 7th member of the 3,000 Strikeouts Club when he fanned Garry Templeton of the Padres.
On July 19, 1982, Tony Gwynn, one of baseball's MOST knowledgable hitters ever, made his Major League debut and true to his fame, had 2 hits.
On August 4, 1982, Joel Youngblood hit a two-run single off Fergie Jenkins during the 3rd inning for the Mets in Chicago. Later that same evening he hit a single off Steve Carlton during the 5th inning for the Expos in Philadelphia. This chain-of-events made Youngblood the first player to hit safely in 2 different cities, for 2 different teams, on the same day.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1983 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Dr. Sally Ride became the first American woman in space (onboard the Space Shuttle Challenger) as a mission specialist on STS-7, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18th.
Over two-hundred American soldiers, acting as Peace-keepers, were killed in Lebanon after a truck loaded with explosives crashed into the U.S. Marine compound at a Beirut Airport. The Marines, who had been in Beirut as part of a multi-national force to promote peace in Lebanon, had become the target of Syrian-supported extremists. The terrorist-style attack resulted in swift U.S. military retaliation and the withdrawal of all American forces from that region.
The U.S. military invaded Grenada in an effort to ensure the safety of 1,100 American citizens who were stuck on the island against the rule of General Hudson Austin and Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard. Both were avowed Marxists who had placed Prime Minister Maurice Bishop under house arrest and threatened to turn the region into another Cuba. Under the guise of an invitation by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, U.S. troops intervened and took control of the island. Unfortunately, sixteen Americans were killed and seventy-seven were injured in the military action.
In the American League...
One of baseball's most modern controversies occurred as the New York Yankees took on the Kansas City Royals in what would be penned as ""The Great Pine Tar Incident"". As Goose Gossage was attempting to protect a 4-3 advantage, George Brett hit a two-run home run putting his team in the lead. That was until home plate umpire Tim McClelland called him out for having more than eighteen inches of pine tar from the end of his bat. The game was immediately protested by Royals skipper Dick Howser and was postponed until several weeks later when they went on to win anyway 5-4.
On July 10th, the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox played the longest nine-inning game in American League history at four hours and eleven minutes. Milwaukee prevailed 12-9 thanks to the arm of Jim Slaton.
The revolving door at the New York Yankees clubhouse continued to spin when Billy Martin was fired as the Bronx Bombers skipper and was replaced by fellow teammate Yogi Berra. Both were hired, fired and rehired repeatedly by George Steinbrenner several times each.
In the National League...
Los Angeles Dodgers ace Fernando Valenzuela set a major league record (off the field) as he became the first player ever to be awarded a $1 million dollar a year contract due to arbitration.
On April 5th, the San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants went head-to-head at Candlestick Park in a 16-13 slugfest that set a new record for the highest scoring Opening Day game in over fifty years.
After twenty-one years and 5,923 innings, Walter Johnson set the all-time career strikeout record of 3,508 in 1927. Fifty-six years later, his record was surpassed twice in the same month. First, Nolan Ryan, of the Houston Astros, achieved the mark after sixteen years and 3,357 innings. Then Steve Carlton, of the Philadelphia Phillies, topped them both at 3,511.
Around the league...
Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle to end all associations with major league baseball after ""The Mick"" became involved in a sports promotion capacity with a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Willie Mays was also targeted with a similar action due to his associations with legalized gambling.
Major League Baseball sold its rights for one year to both ABC and NBC for a combined $1.2 billion dollars. Each team received $7 million dollars as a result of the deal in which ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. Both networks agreed to continue rotating all post-season and All-Star Game coverages.
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was given a $50,000 fine and a one-week suspension after making derogatory remarks about Major League umpires. White Sox president Jerry Reinsdorf was also given a $500 fine after making remarks of his own about the outspoken owner at the All-Star Game.
Steve Howe, then on suspension with the Los Angeles Dodgers, continued to battle his drug addictions after being banned for an entire season by the Commissioners Office. Bowie Kuhn refused to allow the troubled pitcher to return to Major League Baseball until he was proven to be drug-free. Earlier in the season, after completing thirty days of rehabilitation, he was fined $53,867 in salary for missed games in what was the largest fine ever levied to date.
""The difference between the old ballplayer and the new ballplayer is the jersey. The old ballplayer cared about the name on the front. The new ballplayer cares about the name on the back."" - Steve Garvey

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1984 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Republican President Ronald Reagan was reelected after defeating Democratic candidate Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, who was the first female Vice Presidential candidate to represent a major party.
Doctor's replaced the ailing heart of an infant girl known as ""Baby Fae"" with that of a baboon's at Loma Linda University Medical Center in California. Although she died twenty-one days later of organ failure, doctors discovered that she hadn't rejected the heart as many had expected. That gave hope to the doctors and inspired continued research to find a cure for neonatal heart disease.
James Huberty gunned down twenty-one children and adults in a McDonalds restaurant in San Ysidro, California before being shot dead by the police at the scene. The incident was one of the worst mass murders in U.S. history.
In the American League...
On May 9th, Harold Baines hit a 420-foot homerun in the twenty-fifth inning to give the White Sox a 7-6 victory over the visiting Milwaukee Brewers. The eight hour and six minute marathon set an all-time record for the most innings ever played in an American League game as well as the longest game ever in the Major Leagues.
Sparky Anderson's Detroit Tigers echoed the glory days of Cobb as they dominated the American League with a 104-58 record and one-hundred eighty-seven home runs. Lance Parrish hit thirty-three home runs and ninety-eight RBIs while batting .237, Kirk Gibson added twenty-seven round-trippers and ninety-one RBIs plus a .282 average and Alan Trammell led the team with the top average of .314. Jack Morris anchored the Tigers' pitching staff with a 19-11 record and Guillermo Hernandez tallies thirty-two saves in thirty-three opportunities.
On the 17th Anniversary of his first round-tripper, Reggie Jackson launched a Bud Black fastball into the right field stands for his five-hundredth career homer. He was the thirteenth player ever to reach that mark following Willie McCovey in 1978. Unfortunately, ""Mr. October"" and his Anaheim Angels fell 10-1 to the visiting Kansas City Royals.
In the National League...
Pete Rose, then with the Montreal Expos, played in his 3,309th Major League game on June 29th beating Carl Yastrzemski's record as well as his former team the Cincinnati Reds (7-3).
At Fulton County Stadium, the Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres erupted in a ten-minute brawl over a pitching duel that resulted in sixteen major ejections by the officials. Several Major League umpires stated that it was the worst disgrace ever witnessed on a baseball diamond and that it clearly set the game back fifty years in the minds of many fans.
The Chicago Cubs finally won their first title (of any kind) since 1945 after they beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-1 for the National League East.
Around the league...
Due to a strike by the Major League umpires, the first game of the National League Championship Series was called by college replacement officials. The labor dispute was predominately over a pool of $340,000 that the regulars wanted distributed to all umps, including those that were not working the post-season.
""The Natural,"" an instant classic based on the novel by Bernard Malamud, debuted on the big screen with Robert Redford starring as Roy Hobbs, an aging slugger with the New York Knights. The climatic finale is still considered one of the greatest scenes ever filmed on a baseball diamond.
Al Schacht, better known as ""The Clown Prince of Baseball"" died on July 14th at the age of ninety-one. The former Washington Senators pitcher turned top hat jester had entertained the crowd before twenty-five World Series and eighteen All-Star Games.
Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth warned the city of Chicago that he would move all future playoff games involving the Cubs to St. Louis unless outdoor lights were installed at Wrigley Field.
""If I stole a base, it was to help us win a game, and I like to think that's what made me special."" - Joe Morgan

Why did we choose a Joe Morgan quote for our page introduction? Because on the 24th of June he hit his two-hundred sixty-fifth career home run as a second baseman passing Rogers Hornsby for the all-time mark for that position.
On April 13, 1984, Pete Rose became the second player in major league history to record four-thousand career hits. Do you remember which pitcher gave up this significant hit? Do you know what kind of hit it was?
On September 12, 1984, Dwight Gooden of New York struck out sixteen Pittsburgh batters bringing his rookie season total to two-hundred forty-seven - passing the American League and previous major league leading Herb Score strikeout record of two-hundred forty-five.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1985 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
TWA Flight 847 was hijacked by a group of Shi'ite terrorists who were identified as members of Islamic Jihad, a group of various fundamentalists, operating in Lebanon and other Middle East countries. The militant Muslims held one-hundred fifty-three people (including women and children) hostage while demanding the release of their brothers in arms. One passenger, U.S. Navy Diver Robert Stethem was executed and his body was dumped onto the tarmac. After several unsuccessful negotiations, Israel agreed to release thirty-one of its Shi'ite prisoners and the hostages were freed in return.
The wreck of the RMS Titanic (which sunk in 1912 killing 1,522 passengers and crew after striking an iceberg) was finally discovered by a joint U.S.-French expedition who located the remains of the ""unsinkable"" ocean liner three-hundred fifty miles southeast of Newfoundland in thirteen-thousand feet of water.
U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev held a Summit Meeting in Geneva to discuss improving relations between the U.S.S.R. and the United States and to help decrease the risk of nuclear war. In the end, both agreed not to attempt to achieve military superiority and banned the development of chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.
In the American League...
The Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers recorded his two-hundred seventeenth American League career save breaking the record originally set by Sparky Lyle. The victory gave ""The Mustache"" a Major League record of three-hundred twenty-five saves overall. He retired at the end of the season capping off a brilliant seventeen-year career with a 114-118 record, a 2.90 ERA and three-hundred forty-one saves.
On August 4th, Rod Carew of the California Angels achieved a historic milestone by becoming the sixteenth player in Major League Baseball history to reach 3,000 career hits. At 39 years old, Carew solidified his legacy as one of the game's most illustrious hitters.
Major League Baseball's oldest stadium, Chicago's Comiskey Park, celebrated its 75th anniversary with eleven fans in attendance who were present at its opening in 1910. The Seattle Mariners spoiled the festivities with a 3-1 win over the White Sox.
In the National League...
Dwight ""Doc"" Gooden of the New York Mets became the first National League pitcher to reach two-hundred strikeouts in each of his first two seasons as well as the youngest twenty game winner in baseball history. The previous mark was set by Bob Feller in 1939, but Gooden managed to beat him by one month.
Nolan Ryan, of the Houston Astros, struck out Danny Heep, of the New York Mets, to become the first pitcher ever to reach four-thousand strikeouts. The Texas ace went on to sit down ten more batters as the Astros won 4-3 in twelve innings.
Fifty-seven years to the day after Ty Cobb played in his last game, Pete Rose, of the Cincinnati Reds, knocked his 4,192nd career hit breaking ""The Georgia Peach's"" record. Newly approved owner Marge Schott presented Rose with a shiny red Corvette bearing the license plate PR 4192.
Around the league...
Newly appointed Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth reinstated Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle after Commissioner Bowie Kuhn had banned the Hall of Famers from association with Major League Baseball for being employed by companies with ties to legal gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Pittsburgh Associates reached an agreement in principle with the Galbreath family to purchase the sinking Pirates franchise. As a result the team was able to stay afloat in the ""Steel City"" thanks to the combined financial commitments of Pittsburgh's most influential corporations including Carnegie Mellon University, the Aluminum Company of America, Mellon Bank, PNC Financial, PPG Industries, USX Corporation and Westinghouse Electrical Company.
Sports Illustrated pulled off a major April Fool's Day joke by publishing a story about a 168 mph pitching Tibetan Buddhist monk named Sidd Finch who was the New York Mets latest rookie phenomenon. Despite the April 1 date on the article and byline by George Plimpton, many fans believed the story was real and were disappointed after discovering that Finch was a fake.
Major League Baseball players went on strike for two days, August 6 and 7, before reaching a swift resolution. The 25 canceled games were later rescheduled and played before the season's end.
Baseball's Championship Series was altered from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format in an effort to generate up to $9 million dollars in additional revenues.
""I'm just like everybody else. I have two arms, two legs and four-thousand hits."" - Pete Rose

Dwight Gooden truly dominated this season and was the first pitcher since Steve Carlton to earn the Triple Crown of pitching.
Keith Hernandez of the Mets, July 4, 1985, along with Jeffrey Leonard of the Giants, June 27, 1985, were the only two National League players to hit for the cycle.
On November 27, 1985, Vince Coleman won the Rookie of the Year Award and joined Frank Robinson, Orlando Cepeda, and Willie McCovey as the only unanimous winners.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1986 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
After a Libyan-sponsored terrorist attack against Americans in West Germany, U.S. military warplanes attacked various targets in Libya. As a result, the Libyans scaled back their support for terrorist activities against all Western targets.
The Reagan Administration confirmed that it had been selling arms to Iran in an effort to obtain the release of American hostages in Lebanon as part of the ""Iran-Contra Deal"". Money from the sales was used to help the Contras fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
Tragedy struck the NASA Space Program after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after take-off, killing all seven astronauts on board. The crew included the first ""civilian"" ever accepted into the astronaut program, a teacher named Christa McAuliffe. The accident was later blamed on faulty o-rings in the shuttles main booster rocket.
In the American League...
On April 29th, Red Sox ace Roger Clemens struck out twenty Seattle Mariners setting a Major League record for most strikeouts in a single game.
Vincent ""Bo"" Jackson, a Heisman Trophy winner who chose baseball over football, played twenty-five games for the Kansas City Royals as an outfielder and designated hitter, batting .207 with two home runs. The Auburn All-American turned down a $7 million dollar deal from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a much smaller $1 million dollar contract with the Royals because he said he liked baseball best.
The ""Curse of the Bambino"" remained in effect as the Boston Red Sox fell victim to the ""Amazin' Mets"". In Game 6, the Red Sox had a two-run, 10th-inning lead with two outs and no runners on base. Then, after the Mets hit three consecutive singles, a passed ball erased the Red Sox lead, setting up one of the most improbable comebacks in post-season history. When the Mets' Mookie Wilson tapped a grounder down the first base line that somehow found its way between Bill Buckner's legs, the game ended; the costly error gave New York a 6-5 victory, and extended the Series to a Game 7.
In the National League...
On May 31st, a young rookie outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates named Barry Bonds tapped a double off the Los Angeles Dodgers' Rick Honeycutt for his first official Major League hit.
Bob Horner, of the Atlanta Braves, hit four homeruns in a single game against the Montreal Expos. Despite tying the Major League record for solo blasts, Horner's team lost 11-8 to the visiting Canadian franchise.
Forty-five year-old Pete Rose banged out five hits for the tenth time in his career (setting a National League record) as the Cincinnati Reds took on the San Francisco Giants on August 11th. ""Charlie Hustle"" also reached a record 4,256 career at-bats during his last appearance in a Major League line-up.
Around the league...
In an effort to set an example, Commissioner Peter Ueberoth suspended seven players for drug abuse. All seven decided to contribute ten percent of their seasonal salary to drug abuse programs, serve one-hundred hours of community service and be subjected to random drug testing. The seven include Keith Hernandez of the New York Mets, Dale Berra of the New York Yankees, Joaquin Andujar of the Oakland Athletics, Jeffrey Leonard of the San Francisco Giants, Lonnie Smith of the Kansas City Royals, Enos Cabell of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Dave Parker of the Cincinnati Reds.
Bret Saberhagen sued Rawlings over a misrepresented endorsement deal. As many other players were being paid $50,000+ as part of their compensation, the Kansas City Royal pitcher was given two free gloves per season as his contract.
A free baseball promotion night at Arlington Stadium backfired as hundreds of fans targeted the Texas Rangers and umpires after the visiting Milwaukee Brewers rallied for a 10-2 win.
The Chicago Cubs were forced to fire their twenty-eight year old ball girl, Marla Collins, after she posed nude for Playboy. Despite fan support the young lady was terminated for ""behavior unbecoming an employee"" of the franchise.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1987 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the I.N.F. (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty marking the beginning of the end of the Cold War. As a result, Soviets were able to quicken the pace of what was known as ""glasnost"" (openness and reform), which ultimately caused the end of the Soviet empire.
The largest stock-market drop in Wall Street history occurred on October 19, otherwise known as ""Black Monday"" when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508.32 points, losing 22.6% of its total value. That fall far surpassed the one-day loss of 12.9% that began the great stock market crash of 1929 and foreshadowed the Great Depression.
The Iraqi Air Force attacked the U.S.S. Stark, a United States Navy ship in the Persian Gulf, initiating an ongoing hostile relationship that would eventually result in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.
In the American League...
A high school outfielder named Ken Griffey, Jr. was selected by the Seattle Mariners as their first overall pick in the 1987 Amateur Draft.
After hitting a meager .220 with fifteen home runs for the Oakland Athletics, forty-one year old Reggie Jackson finally retired. ""Mr. October"" had played twenty-one years in the Major Leagues and totaled five-hundred sixty-three home runs, one-thousand seven-hundred two runs batted in and a .262 batting average. He also held the all time record for strikeouts with two-thousand five-hundred ninety-seven and the best slugging average in World Series play with .755.
At an exhibition game in Toronto, the Blue Jays became the first team ever to hit ten home runs in a single game as they bombed the Baltimore Orioles 18-3. The previous team record was originally set by the Yankees in 1939 and equaled by several other teams over the years. The combined eleven home runs in the contest also tied a two-team Major League record.
In the National League...
The New York Mets' Dwight ""Doc"" Gooden entered a twenty-eight day drug rehabilitation program at the Smithers Alcoholism Treatment Center. The 1985 Cy Young Award winner had tested positive for cocaine use and would not return to start the season until June 5th.
On April 18th, Mike Schmidt, of the Philadelphia Phillies, launched a three-run blast over the wall at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium for his 500th career home run. The historic shot put the All-Star third baseman in the company of just thirteen other players in Major League history.
Eric Davis was on a tear for the Cincinnati Reds, rewriting National League record books with his sheer power at the plate. In a jaw-dropping stretch across April and May, he launched three grand slams in a single month—an NL record—and followed it up with an astonishing 19 home runs over two months, setting another league mark. Davis was unstoppable, sending baseballs soaring and leaving pitchers shaking their heads as he carved his name into history with every swing.
Around the league...
The Major League Players Association filed a grievance accusing the owners of acting together to restrict player's salaries. The association cited the lack of offers to free agents from 1985-1987, which resulted in them returning to their original teams. In a study from the 1985 season, it was estimated that free agents lost between $70 and $90 million dollars.
The ""Rookie of the Year Award"" was renamed ""The Jackie Robinson Award"" in both the American and National Leagues.
On October 17th, the Minnesota Twins welcomed the St. Louis Cardinals to the Metrodome for the first World Series game ever played indoors. The home team dominated the visitors 10-1 in front of a capacity crowd of 55,171.
Major League attendance reached an all-time high in 1987 with a combined 52,029,664 people going out to the ballparks.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1998 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Senator John Glenn blasted off for the second time at age seventy-seven to participate in a study of the effects of weightlessness and space stress on the elderly. The veteran astronaut had no difficulties performing his duties aboard the Space Shuttle and returned to earth with flying colors.
The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, and Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern had a sex scandal dubbed Sexgate by the media. Clinton, 49 years old, and Lewinsky, 22 years old started their sexual relationship in 1995, ended it in 1997, and made national news when coming Clinton made the following infamous statement on January 26, 1998, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.""
Seventy-six million people tuned in to view the last installment of a ""show about nothing"" as Seinfeld broadcasted its farewell performance. The series is still the most widely viewed sitcom ever in syndication and has made creator Jerry Seinfeld one of the wealthiest royalty recipients in the history of television.
In the American League...
The Oakland Athletics Rickey Henderson scored the 2,000th run of his career in the A's 15-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians. In doing so, he joined Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth, Pete Rose, and Willie Mays as the only players to reach the milestone.
Cal Ripken started his 2,500th consecutive game as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Oakland A's, 8-2. In perspective, the subsequent twenty-two longest active streaks (combined) add up to less than the ""Iron Man's"" own total.
Manager Joe Torre's Yankees outplayed the 1927 team and finished the season with an astonishing one hundred, fourteen regular-season wins and eleven postseason victories. The Bombers win column represented the most ""Ws"" by any team in one hundred, twenty-three years of Major League baseball.
In the National League...
Montreal Expos skipper Felipe Alou tallied his 521st career-win as manager thanks to veteran pitcher Dustin Hermanson who was also the starter in Alou's 400th, 450th, and 500th wins.
On September 8th, St. Louis Cardinal Mark McGwire topped Roger Maris' single-season home run mark by slugging his sixty-second of the year off the Chicago Cubs' Steve Trachsel. Fittingly, Sammy Sosa, McGwire's closest running mate in the race to break sixty-one, was in attendance on the field.
San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds hit his 400th home run, off the Florida Marlins' Kirt Ojala and became the first player in Major League history to boast four-hundred homeruns and four-hundred steals in a career.
Around the League...
Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray died at the age of eighty-four, four days after collapsing at a Valentine's Day dinner. The Wrigley Field icon, known best for leading the fans in the traditional rendition of ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" left behind countless memories from a career that spanned half a century.
In an effort to secure financial stability, the Cleveland Indians requested permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell four million shares of the team to the public.
Congress finally passed a bill that removed part of baseball's seventy-six year antitrust exemption. The groundbreaking citation was supported by both the owners and the players union and was later signed by President Bill Clinton.
In November, Yankee and A's icon Jim ""Catfish"" Hunter was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an ultimately fatal neurological condition better known as ""Lou Gehrig's disease.""
""If it (Mark McGwire's homer) hadn't hit the scoreboard, it could have gone all the way around the world and hit me in the back of my head."" - Sandy Alomar, Jr.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1999 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
President Bill Clinton was acquitted of impeachment charges and remained in office despite originally denying that he had improper relations with a White House intern. After a thorough investigation it was later discovered that the President had lied under oath and he eventually confessed and apologized to the American people.
The disturbing trend of violence in American schools reached an all-time high as two students entered Columbine High School with an arsenal of weapons and explosives killing thirteen of their classmates before taking their own lives.
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister in-law were killed as their plane, piloted by JFK Jr., crashed en route to a Kennedy cousin's wedding ceremony.
In the American League...
In a surprise move, the New York Yankees traded pitcher David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays for five-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens. Both are later reunited in pinstripes on the same Yankee rotation.
Texas Ranger Ivan ""Pudge"" Rodriguez tied the highest batting average for a catcher since Bill Dickey batted .332 in 1937. He also added thirty-five home runs, twenty-five stolen bases and one-hundred thirteen runs batted in to his cumulative stats.
The Baltimore Orioles traveled to Havana Cuba to play the national team in an exhibition game witnessed by the attending Fidel Castro. The Blackbirds defeated the Cubans 3-2 in an eleven inning affair. Two months later, the tables were turned though as the national team traveled to Camden Yards and crushed the home team 12-6 in the first game ever played between the two countries on American soil.
In the National League...
""The Big Unit"", Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks, continued to dominate on the hill winning the National League Cy Young with a 17-9 record, 2.48 ERA, twelve complete games and an astonishing three-hundred sixty-four strike outs.
On April 23rd, St. Louis Cardinal Fernando Tatis set a Major League record as the only player ever to hit two grand slams in a single inning as well as the only player ever to drive-in eight runs during a single frame. Both slams are off of the Los Angeles Dodgers' Chan Ho Park who had certainly seen better days on the mound.
Another Cardinal, Mark McGwire continued to set a new standard at the plate by following up his record-breaking seventy-home run season with sixty-five more. The St. Louis slugger now held the #1 and #2 spots for single-season performances and belted his 500th career homer only a year after slamming number four-hundred.
Around the League...
Commissioner Bud Selig announced baseball's newest annual award created for the leading hitter in each respective league. Named after Hank Aaron, the citation recognizes the leader in hits, home runs and runs batted in.
The Associated Press reported that the average salary for a Major League ball player had grown to an astonishing $1.7 million dollars a year. The New York Times later printed that the average salary for a New York Yankee was $3 million much to the dismay of the rest of the league.
Baseball announced its twenty-five man All-Century Team as selected by fan balloting. The line-up included: Lou Gehrig (1B), Jackie Robinson (2B), Cal Ripken Jr. (SS), Mike Schmidt (3B), Babe Ruth (OF), Hank Aaron (OF), Ted Williams (OF), Johnny Bench (C), Nolan Ryan (RHP) and Sandy Koufax (LHP).
Baseball and the world bid farewell to Joe DiMaggio who passed away on May 8th. During his fabled thirteen-year career, ""The Yankee Clipper"" captured three Most Valuable Player trophies and became one of the most revered players ever to lace up a pair of cleats.
""You're as famous as Mark McGwire"" said a fan at the game, ""I don't want to go there!"" - Pitcher Jose Jimenez after tossing his no-hitter

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2000 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
""Y2K"" spawned a paranoid phenomenon due to the impending threat of the world's computers crashing. Despite millions of dollars and countless man-hours spent in preparation, the impending cyber-disaster amounted to nothing.
The U.S. presidential race between Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democratic hopeful Al Gore ended amid controversy. The world watched as the most powerful nation on earth used the courts to sort out what was the most evenly divided recent presidential election of the United States.
After years of delays, the International Space Station was finally operating in orbit thanks to a combined effort of technological resources from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Russia, eleven nations of the European Space Agency and Brazil.
In the American League...
Shortstop sensation Nomar Garciaparra earned his second consecutive batting title and Pedro Martinez earned his third Cy Young Award in four years, but it wasn't enough to get the Red Sox to the playoffs for a third consecutive season. Despite their best efforts, ""The Curse of the Bambino"" continued to reign as the Sox finished 2½ games behind the Yankees in the American League East.
The Detroit Tigers topped the Minnesota Twins, 12-11 on October 1st, as Shane Halter became the fourth Major Leaguer in history to play all nine positions in a game. Both teams combined to use fifteen pitchers, tying the Major League mark and setting an American League record.
The Cleveland Indians became the leagues fifth, triple play victim at the hands of the Baltimore Orioles during a September 1st outing. With runners at first and second and no outs, shortstop Melvin Mora intentionally dropped Sandy Alomar's pop fly, then threw to Jerry Hairston who tagged the runner at second as well as the runner coming from first. A confused Alomar retreated to the dugout believing the infield fly rule is in effect and was called out for leaving the basepath.
In the National League...
Major league baseball ordered Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker to undergo psychological testing following racial remarks he had made during an off-season interview with Sports Illustrated. He was later suspended for fourteen days and allowed to attend Spring Training after paying an undisclosed fine and attending sensitivity training.
The Chicago Cubs christened the 2000 season by defeating the New York Mets, 5-3 in the Tokyo Dome in Japan marking the first Major League game ever played on Asian soil.
Following the death of Montreal Canadian Maurice Richard, the Expos announced that they would wear ""The Rocket's"" number nine for the remainder of the season as a tribute to the late hockey icon. It was the first time that a Major League Baseball team was believed to have honored an athlete from another sport.
Around the League...
American League president Gene Budig resigned and was appointed a senior adviser to baseball commissioner Bud Selig. The American and National leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities with all rights and functions consolidated in the commissioner's office.
Following a May 16th incident in which sixteen Los Angeles Dodger players and three coaches entered the stands during a fight with fans at Wrigley Field, nineteen suspensions are handed out resulting in the loss of sixty games for the players and twenty-four for the coaches.
Andrew Klein, a boy who was struck in the head and suffered permanent brain damage while attending batting practice before a Florida Marlins game in 1997, was finally awarded $1.05 million by a state court jury. The decision set the stage for limiting children's access to players on the field and required stricter safety guidelines for kid's pre-game ballpark programs.
Four American League teams finished with a better winning percentage than the New York Yankees. However, the Bronx Bombers were really not concerned with the final standings and progressed through the post-season with ease defeating their cross-town rival Mets four games to one in the fourteenth rendition of the ""Subway Series"".
""He's (Mike Hampton of the New York Mets) been pitching that way all year (2000). We just haven't scored enough runs for him."" - Robin Ventura

For the second time in the nation's history, a president's son followed in his father's footsteps as George W. Bush (Jr.) was sworn in as the United States 43rd leader.
On September 11 the world changed forever as two hijacked airplanes were flown into the World Trade Center's twin towers and a third airplane hit the Pentagon in Washington DC. A fourth plane was brought down before reaching its intended target by a heroic group of passengers in a field in western Pennsylvania. In the end, over 3,300 innocent people were killed and the United States along with a coalition of over sixty countries declared war on terrorism.
The New York Yankees weren't the only baseball team from the Bronx that played well in 2001, only to come up short in the end. The Little League team from the South Bronx stole the show at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, but was later disqualified after it was discovered that star pitcher Danny Almonte was actually a fifteen year-old ringer.
In the American League...
Baltimore Orioles icon ""Iron Man"" Cal Ripken re-enacted the final scene from ""The Natural"" with a dramatic home run blast in the third inning off of Chan Ho Park during his final All-Star Game appearance.
Despite losing three of their greatest players (Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson and Alex Rodriguez) the resilient Seattle Mariners set the record for most wins in a season for an American League club, bettering the mark of one-hundred fourteen set by the already legendary 1998 Yankees. Japanese sensation Ichiro Suzuki sweetens the deal by winning Rookie of the Year as well as the Most Valuable Player.
The New York Yankees' Mike Mussina comes within one batter of perfection, but Carl Everett's two-out, ninth-inning single spoiled the Moose's bid for a perfect game. In the end, the right-handed veteran finished with a one-hitter and the Yankees swept the Boston Red Sox at Fenway.
In the National League...
A new era of baseball in Pittsburgh began with the opening of PNC Park resembling the classic stadiums of old. The park served as the fifth home for the Buccos replacing Three Rivers Stadium, which had replaced the sacred grounds at Forbes Field. Unfortunately, Pirate legend Willie Stargell died the evening before its Opening Day casting a dark shadow over the debut festivities.
Barry Bonds of the Giants broke St. Louis Cardinals' slugger Mark McGwire's single-season home run record. Before an ecstatic throng at San Francisco's Pac Bell Park, the Hall-of-Fame-bound outfielder took Chan Ho Park deep for No. 71. He would later go on to reset the record at seventy-three.
In one of the most exciting editions of the World Series, the adolescent Arizona Diamondbacks beat the 3x defending champion New York Yankees after Luis Gonzalez lined a Series-winning single off closer Mariano Rivera in the ninth inning of Game 7.
Around the League...
Major League Baseball rose to the occasion as part of the post 9/11 healing process. After taking center stage with patriotic tributes throughout the remainder of the regular season, the national pastime returned to the Big Apple to host the World Series. With the city's emotions running high and the American flag pulled from the wreckage of the World Trade Center flying overhead, President George W. Bush threw out the first pitch symbolizing the unwavering strength of America.
The 1-2 pitching combination of Arizona Diamondbacks Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson results in the first World Series Co-Most Valuable Players.
The 2001 season ended bittersweet as fans say goodbye to two future hall-of-famers in Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres and Cal Ripken Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles.
The Baseball Hall of Fame congratulated its newest inductees including Kirby Puckett, Dave Winfield, Hilton Smith and Bill Mazeroski (who finally opened the door for defensive players).
""People will come out to see great players, but you know you're looking at a very special player when they come out like this just to watch him (Mark McGwire) take batting practice."" - Dave Parker

The Chicago Cubs began playing National League baseball in 1876 and this particular pitching staff set the franchise record for most strikeouts during a single season with 1,344.
On October 4, 1999, the Cincinnati Reds were shutout 5-to-0 by the New York Mets in a one game playoff that cost them a postseason berth. The Reds were not shutout again, for a National League record 208 games, until May 24, 2001 when the Chicago Cubs beat them 3-to-0 behind a 1 hit / 1 walk Jon Leiber gem.
Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants had one of the most amazing seasons by any player in Major League history and Baseball Almanac is pleased to list a handful of his accomplishments in 2001: On April 17, 2001, Bonds joined the 500 Home Runs Club and set new single season records for fastest to reach 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 home runs before breaking the all-time single season mark. Bonds also broke Babe Ruth's record for slugging percentage in a season, Roger Maris' record for home runs in a season by a left-handed hitter, and at his age became the oldest player to reach 50, 60, and 70 as well as the oldest player to lead the Major Leagues in home runs.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2002 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
Big business took the witness stand in 2002 as Enron, WorldCom and Xerox were all exposed in major accounting scandals. The total cost of corporate fraud in the United States was estimated at more than five trillion dollars, coming in plunging stocks, loss of investments and tax revenue.
Russian President Vladimir Putin signed with U.S. President George W. Bush in Moscow a nuclear disarmament treaty and a strategic partnership agreement. Under the treaty, the two countries pledged to slash their nuclear arsenals by two-thirds.
On September 11, tributes around the nation showcased American emotion and patriotic pride on the one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States. Major League Baseball held special opening ceremonies in every ballpark operating that day.
In the American League...
The Anaheim Angels dethroned the perennial American League Champion New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins to face the San Francisco Giants in their first Fall Classic since entering the league forty-two years earlier. The victory was sweetened by overcoming a 5-0 seventh-inning deficit in Game 6, fittingly the greatest elimination-game comeback in Classic history. The Angels went on to win the contest four games to three.
From August 13th to September 4th, Most Valuable Player Miguel Tejada and the Oakland Athletics set an American League record of twenty straight wins.
Seattle's Mike Cameron hit four homers in Comiskey Park on May 2nd, becoming the first Major Leaguer in nine years (Mark Whiten, 1993) to manage the feat. He was outdone twenty-one days later in Milwaukee as the Los Angeles Dodgers' Shawn Green totaled a six-for-six, nineteen total base spectacle and finished the week with nine home runs of his own.
In the National League...
Barry Bonds continued to chase Babe Ruth as the most dominant player in MLB history. The San Francisco Giants outfielder tallied his 600th home run off the Pittsburgh Pirates' Kip Wells on August 9th and won his first batting title (.370) before falling to the Anaheim Angels in Game 7 of the World Series.
The Arizona Diamondbacks continued to dominate on the mound as Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling went 47-12 and ranked 1-2 in the Majors with a combined total of six-hundred fifty strikeouts. The lethal 1-2 combination also boasted thirteen complete games, more than any other big-league team.
No one demonstrated more resolve than the Cardinals, who experienced the untimely deaths of longtime announcer Jack Buck and pitcher Darryl Kile. The team, though mourning, went on to dominate the National League Central dedicating the season in the memory of their departed comrades.
Around the League...
Major League owners and players, inevitably heading toward a ninth play stoppage over labor issues, reached accord virtually minutes before the first feared cancellation. It was the first time a new Collective Bargaining Agreement was struck without the loss of a single inning.
For only the second time in the History of the Midsummer Classic, the 2002 All-Star Game was called at a 7-7 tie after eleven innings due to both teams running out of available pitchers.
The West was the best as six of the nine West Division teams won ninety-two-plus games (more teams than the other four divisions combined) and West players dominated the individual awards including the Cy Young, Most Valuable Player and eight of the nine American League Gold Gloves.
Baseball bid farewell to some of the greatest ever to lace up a pair of cleats including Ted Williams, Jim Spencer, Al Cowens, Minnie Rojas, Joe Black, Wes Westrum, Darrell Porter, Enos Slaughter, John Roseboro, Hoyt Wilhelm and Darryl Kile.
""I'd rather win the World Series, but this (winning the MVP Award) is great. I'm very happy about it, very excited. I'm trying to figure out why a 38-year-old player is still playing like this. Forget the historical part about MVPs. I'm overjoyed, very happy, very pleased, especially coming off the 73-home-run year, to be able to pretty much stay consistent."" - Barry Bonds (2002)

Why did Barry Bonds win the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 2002? Perhaps it was due to list of records: highest on-base percentage in a single season, highest on base percentage in a single season by a lefthanded batter, most consecutive seasons with thirty (or more) home runs (this was his eleventh), most seasons leading the league in base on balls (this was his eighth), and many others.
On July 15, 2002, Chris Reitsma pitched a 2-0 complete game victory for his Cincinnati Reds - the first complete game tossed by a Reds' pitcher since July 28, 2001 (a National League record one-hundred fifty game span).
The New York Mets had the highest payroll in the National League East, the third highest payroll overall in the National league, and might be best remembered for breaking the National League record for most consecutive games lost at home during a single season with fifteen.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2003 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
After the U.N. repeatedly failed in its efforts to uncover weapons of mass destruction or identify links between Saddam Hussein and international terrorists, the United States and a group of coalition forces joined together for a pre-emptive strike aimed at disarming Iraq. On March 19th, the U.S. launched what would become known as Operation ""Shock and Awe"" as a ""decapitation attack"" aimed at the Iraqi President and other top members of the country's leadership. More than forty satellite-guided Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from U.S. warships in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf with support from multiple squadrons of F-117 stealth fighters, carrying 2,000-pound bombs. Although the initial attack failed to eliminate Saddam, it only took twenty-one days for coalition forces to eliminate the Republican Guard and take the capital city of Baghdad. For the first time in history, people from around the world were able to watch the war effort live via embedded war journalists and strategically placed web cams.
Tragedy struck the NASA Space Program after the space shuttle Columbia broke up during re-entry fifteen minutes before its scheduled landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Those killed on the ill-fated flight were commander Rick D. Husband; pilot William C. McCool; payload commander Michael P. Anderson; mission specialists David M. Brown, Kalpana Chawla and Laurel Clark; as well as Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon. An investigation into the explosion later revealed that a piece of foam designed to protect the vehicle from heat had dislodged during take-off, striking the left wing. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's shuttle fleet, had first launched in 1981 and was completing its twenty-eighth mission. Ironically, the accident occurred less than a week after the anniversaries of two other deadly space program disasters: the seventeenth anniversary of the explosion of the shuttle Challenger (January 28) and the thirty-sixth anniversary of a launch pad fire that killed three Apollo astronauts (January 27).
In the American League...
New York Yankees ace Roger Clemens joined one of the most exclusive clubs in sports after becoming the twenty-first pitcher in Major League history to win three-hundred games. After announcing his intentions to retire at the end of the 2003 season, Clemens went on to complete his quest for three-hundred by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals, 5-2, in front of a sold-out crowd at Yankee Stadium. In doing so ""The Rocket"" became the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1990 to reach three-hundred wins, tying Hall-of-Famers Early Wynn and Lefty Grove for nineteenth place on the all-time victory list. Later he joined another ""pitching fraternity"" after striking out the four-thousandth batter of his career. Only Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Steve Carlton (4,136) had more strikeouts than Clemens (to date), who had ten on the night. Ironically, Carlton had also won his three-hundredth against the Cardinals in 1983.
The ongoing rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees came to a head during Game 3 of the American League Championship Series after both dugouts emptied twice due to what some felt was ""overly-aggressive"" pitching. The ensuing argument was first instigated after Boston ace Pedro Martinez struck Yankees' designated hitter Karim Garcia in the back and was fueled by Manny Ramirez who took offense to a high pitch thrown by Roger Clemens. As both dugouts cleared, New York's bench coach Don Zimmer charged at Martinez who promptly reacted by throwing the seventy-two year-old to the ground. After several minutes of suspended play, both teams went back to business until a second brawl erupted in the Yankees bullpen between Jeff Nelson, Garcia and a member of Fenway Park's grounds crew. Following the 4-3 Yankees victory, Major League Baseball issued fines to Martinez, Ramirez, Garcia and Zimmer while the Boston Police issued additional charges on Garcia and Nelson for their involvement in the bullpen altercation.
In the National League...
The entire baseball world was shocked after one of its most beloved athletes Sammy Sosa was ejected in the first inning of a Chicago Cubs versus Tampa Bay Devil Rays game after umpires found cork in his shattered bat. Sosa, who had recently joined the five-hundred home run club and gained national prominence in 1998 during his home-run battle with Mark McGwire, apologized to fans, his teammates and the Commissioner of Baseball. Stating that the corked bat had been strictly used for batting practice and mistakenly taken to the plate, Sosa received a seven-game suspension following an appeal. Sosa's other bats, which had been confiscated by security personnel and turned over to Major League Baseball, showed no signs of tampering. Still, many doubted the integrity of Sammy's previous accomplishments and it would be some time before he would be back in the fan's favor.
Los Angeles Dodgers closer Eric Gagne set a new Major League record after converting fifty-five saves to top Boston's Tom Gordon, who had previously converted fifty-four in a row from April 19, 1998, to June 5, 1999. Practically ""un-hittable"" throughout the season, Gagne had increased the velocity on his fastball from ninety-two miles-per-hour to ninety-seven and complemented it with a hard eighty-seven mile-per-hour changeup that dropped much like a split-finger pitch. His forty-first consecutive win gave him the longest saves streak to start a season in Major League history and he also became the first relief pitcher in history to tally one-hundred more strikeouts (137) than hits allowed (37).
Around the League...
Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler collapsed at the team's spring training complex in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on February 16th and died the next day. Following an autopsy, it was determined that the twenty-three year-old had suffered a ""heart attack-like event"" after taking a dietary supplement containing ephedra. His widow later filed a $600 million lawsuit against the manufacturers while bringing national attention to the dangers of using potentially harmful weight loss aids. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, called the product Xenadrine RFA-1 a ""poisonous cocktail"" unsafe for human consumption.
Major League Baseball's marketing division attempted to restore the fan's faith in the All-Star Game and make amends for the 2002 debacle that had ended in a 7-7 tie after both leagues ran out of available pitchers. To add more meaning to the fledgling exhibition, the 2003 Midsummer Classic slogan read ""This Time It Counts"" and for the first time in professional baseball history, home-field advantage in the World Series would be granted to the winner. The enticing proposal initially appeared to be more than just a marketing ploy as the last team to overcome the ""home-field curse"" was the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had beaten the odds (and the Baltimore Orioles) while away in 1979. However, despite winning 7-6, the American League later proved that home-field advantage was overrated after the Florida Marlins toppled the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium.
After years of less-than-stellar ratings, record audiences finally tuned in to the Major League Baseball postseason, making it the most-watched playoffs ever on cable. Fans also flocked to the ballparks setting a new attendance mark with over 1,858,979 tickets sold. Many attributed this renewed interest to the playoff's storybook backdrop that featured two of baseball's most beloved underdogs, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. Both teams had surprised the experts by making the post season and each continued to shock their opponents by battling back in their respective leagues time and time again. After surviving the Divisional round, generations of long-suffering fans from both ball clubs reveled in the possibility that the curse of both ""The Bambino"" and ""The Goat"" was finally coming to an end. The baseball god's apparently had other plans and both teams fell just five heartbreaking outs short of making it to the Series.
""It's probably the biggest moment of my professional career (winning 9-6 in Game 7 versus Chicago)I can't even explain it. It probably hasn't even sunk in yet, but I do know that it's a wonderful feeling. People asked me was I going to come back for next year, and I told them if I get in the World Series and manage the All-Star team, I'll definitely be back."" - Florida Marlins Manager Jack McKeon

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2004 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The Olympics returned to their birthplace (Athens, Greece) amidst a stream of controversies involving the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs. Despite the resulting suspensions and stripped titles, many experts believed the 2004 Games would be remembered for the improvement in drug testing which allowed honest athletes to prevail. One Greek newspaper summed up the media's bemusement at the number of cheaters discovered with a cartoon depicting a young boy, with a gold medal round his neck, being surrounded by microphones saying: ""I am only a volunteer, but everyone else has tested positive.""
During the summer of 2004, North America, Central America and the Caribbean experienced one of the deadliest hurricane seasons ever recorded. During the months of August and September alone, four major storms (Jeanne, Ivan, Frances, Charley) pounded the southeastern part of the globe killing well over 2,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands more homeless. As a result, a record setting number of tornadoes (173 in August, 247 in September) were also spawned as the left over tropical depressions moved inland and up the eastern coast. The total cost in damage from winds and flooding was estimated to run well into the multi-billions and was spread from the island of Haiti to upstate New York.
2004 also marked one of the most widely anticipated presidential elections in recent history. Republican President George W. Bush, son of former President Bush, made a run for a second term after being elected in the hotly contested 2000 campaign. At that time he was mid-way through his second term as governor of Texas, a position he assumed in 1994. Prior to running for governor he spent several years in the oil business and as the managing general partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. His opponent, Democratic candidate Senator John Kerry was a decorated Vietnam War veteran who returned from the conflict to become one of the most outspoken opponents of the war. After entering politics in 1982, when he was elected lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, he ran for U.S. Senate on a campaign that refused contributions from political action committees. He was reelected in 1986, 1990, 1996 and 2002.
In the American League...
Baltimore Oriole Miguel Tejada won the 2004 Home Run Derby after edging the Houston Astros' Lance Berkman with five homers in the final round. The All-Star shortstop set two MLB records in the process by hitting a total of twenty-seven round-trippers for the night and fifteen in the second round. Amazingly, Tejada's final five blasts came after five outs, half of the requisite total.
Seattle Mariners sensation Ichiro Suzuki broke George Sisler's 1920 single season hitting record during an 8-3 victory over the Texas Rangers. With fans still cheering, Suzuki ran to the first-base seats and shook hands with Sisler's 81-year-old daughter and other members of the Hall of Famer's family. After Suzuki's record breaking 258th hit, he scored his 100th run of the season when the Mariners batted around in the third, taking a 6-2 lead on six hits.
The Cleveland Indians scalped the New York Yankees with a record-setting 22-0 massacre on August 31st. With the defeat, the Bombers lost their fifth consecutive game in the Bronx for the first time since May of 2003. The twenty-two runs allowed were the most ever given up by the Yankees in their home ballpark and the most runs allowed since 1928, when the Indians won a 24-6 decision (one of two eighteen-run defeats in New York history). The loss also tied the largest margin of defeat in a shutout since 1900, equaling the mark set in 1975 by the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 22-0 win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.
In the National League...
San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds continued his relentless assault on the major league record books in 2004. His season highlights included: (September 17th) Hit his 700th career homer, off San Diego's Jake Peavy. (September 11th) Broke his own record for walks in a season and became the first player to earn two-hundred free passes in one campaign. (August 29th) Recorded his sixty-eighth career multi-homer game, passing Mark McGwire for second all-time. (August 13th) Singled in his 1,813th run, passing Frank Robinson for fourteenth on the all-time RBI list. (July 10th) Broke his own record for intentional walks in a season with the first of three in the game. (July 8th) Passed Eddie Murray (5,397) for eighth place on the all-time total bases list. (July 4th) Received two walks from the Athletics to tie and break Rickey Henderson's all-time walks record. (June 13th) Hit his 500th homer as a Giant. (June 12th) Homered off the 400th different pitcher of his career, Baltimore's Rodrigo Lopez. (May 28th) Hit his tenth career walk-off homer, a two-run shot off Colorado's Tim Harikkala. (April 29th) Hit his 668th career homer, giving him and his late father Bobby a combined one-thousand home runs. (April 17th) Scored his 2,063rd run, putting him alone in seventh place all-time, with a solo homer off Los Angeles' Darren Dreifort. (April 13th) Hit his 661st career homer, off Milwaukee's Ben Ford, to assume sole possession of third place on the all-time list. (April 12th) Hit his 660th career homer, off Milwaukee's Matt Kinney, to tie godfather Willie Mays for third on the all-time list.
After enjoying a brief, seventy-eight day retirement, Roger Clemens returned to pitch with friend and former teammate Andy Pettitte on their hometown Houston Astros. For more than a year, ""The Rocket"" had insisted that 2003 would be his final season, but all bets were off after the Yankees lost the World Series and Pettitte left New York. Remarkably, the forty year-old, six-time Cy Young winner, returned better than ever becoming a NL Cy Young candidate en route to the National League Championship Series.
Randy Johnson, of the Arizona Diamondbacks, turned his back on the clock on his amazing career after pitching a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves on May 18th. In doing so, the forty year-old became the first ace to toss a perfect game since David Cone of the New York Yankees accomplished the feat in 1999. He also became the oldest pitcher in baseball history to do so, followed by Cy Young who had reached perfection at the age of 37 in 1904. Johnson's masterpiece came in a 2-0 win at Turner Field that took only two hours and thirteen minutes to complete. Afraid to ""jinx"" the outcome, neither the scoreboard nor public address system noted the history in the making and only displayed Johnson's picture and stats after the final pitch had been made.
Around the League...
America's ""National Pastime"" returned to the capital for the first time in thirty-three years after Major League Baseball approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC. Ironically, the announcement came one day before the anniversary of the original Washington Senators' final game (before moving to Texas) in 1971. The relocation of the Expos was subject to certain contingencies, including a vote by team owners in November and passage of legislation by Washington's City Council to build a ballpark on the Anacostia River waterfront.
One day after the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti (an admitted steroid user) U.S. lawmakers passed legislation allowing tighter government regulation of steroid precursors. In doing so, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act added androstenedione, norandrosterone and similar testosterone-production enhancing substances to a list of anabolic steroids regarded as controlled substances. Caminiti, who had played in the major leagues for fifteen years, died of an apparent heart attack at age forty-one. He had admitted to using steroids during his Most Valuable Player season in 1996, when he hit .326 with forty home runs and one-hundred thirty runs batted in for the San Diego Padres.
""I'm very proud of him (Greg Maddux) and I'm proud I had the opportunity to play with him. He was the epitome of consistency over his career. He's done a wonderful job to get to the point he's at. Those who know him will probably show much more excitement and emotion over it than he will. At some point, though, he'll break down and let everyone know what his career has meant to him. But I don't anticipate it at three-hundred.""- New York Mets Pitcher / Former TeammateTom Glavine on MLB.com (August 7, 2004)

The last National League pitcher to join the 300 Wins Club was Steve Carlton of the Philadelphia Phillies on September 23, 1983. The Mad Dog, Greg Maddux, returned to the Cubs rotation and won his three-hundredth game on August 7, 2004, versus the San Francisco Giants.
On April 6, 2004, David Aardsma of the San Francisco Giants played in his first ever major league ballgame and as he stepped onto the field, he was booed loudly. Why? Aardsma alphabetically now replaces Hank Aaron at the top of the baseball biographical player list.
Ken Griffey, Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds joined the 500 Home Runs Club on June 20, 2004, putting three (3) of the four (4) active five-hundred home runs club members in the National League in 2004 —Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey, Jr. & Sammy Sosa.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2005 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
2005 will be remembered as a year in which the world seemed to be peppered with natural disasters including floods, earthquakes, mudslides, wild fires and even a tsunami (late December 2004). Tropical storms reached an all-time high as the National Hurricane Service ran out of letters from the English alphabet for naming them. The eleventh, christened ""Hurricane Katrina,"" first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Miami, Florida on August 25, 2005 and then again on August 29th, along the Central Gulf Coast near New Orleans, Louisiana, as a Category 4 storm. The hurricane resulted in several breaches of the levee system that protected New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain, and most of the city was subsequently flooded by the lake's waters. This and other major damage to the coastal regions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama made Katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. In the end, Katrina was responsible for $200 billion dollars in damage, and over 1,200 deaths. In addition, more than one-million people were left displaced, creating a humanitarian crisis unlike anything experienced in modern times.
""Operation Enduring Freedom"" marked its fourth anniversary, as American military and coalition forces continued their global war on terrorism. Originally launched in October of 2001 (as both a counter attack and pre-emptive strike, following the attacks on September 11th), the Allied Forces targeted far more than al Qaeda training camps and facilities and the repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The ongoing battle against insurgents in Baghdad, the liberation of the Iraqi people, the drafting of an Iraqi Constitution, and the trial of captured dictator Saddam Hussein were just a few of the major issues in an ongoing war that sparked both controversy and debate around the world.
NASA finally returned to space, after a 2½ year absence, following the accidental explosion and loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and her seven-member crew (STS-107) over Texas in February of 2003. After a year of investigation, resulting in the institution of several new safety features and protocols, the Space Shuttle Discovery launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on July 26, 2005. STS-114 included breathtaking in-orbit maneuvers, tests of new equipment and procedures, and a first-of-its-kind space-walking repair. NASA later announced that the next Shuttle mission, STS-121, was targeted for March of 2006 and would be the second test flight to the International Space Station in the ""Shuttle Return to Flight"" series.
In the American League...
Baltimore Oriole and Dominican superstar Miguel Tejada was awarded the ""Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award"" for his efforts in leading the American League to a 7-5 victory over the National League in the 76th All-Star Game in Detroit. In doing so, Tejada became the fifth Latin-American born player among the last eight MVP winners. The victory increased the American League's unbeaten streak to nine and netted its third straight home-field advantage in the World Series.
2005 was also the seventeenth (and final) big-league season of one of baseball's perennial journeyman, John Olerud. With a stellar career as a Toronto Blue Jay, New York Met, Seattle Mariner, New York Yankee, and Boston Red Sox, Olerud's resume boasted a .295 average, with 2,239 hits, 7,592 at-bats, two World Championships, three Gold Gloves, and one batting title. Retiring as a first-baseman with the Boston Red Sox, Olerud left behind a wonderful ""blue-collar"" legacy as both a players' player and a fan favorite. Well known for not having played a single game in the minor leagues, Olerud moved directly to the majors after an outstanding career at Washington State University where he was a pitcher. Drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the third round of the 1989 Amateur Draft, he had to wear a batting helmet in the field because of a brain aneurysm in younger life.
Following in the footsteps of the ""Cinderella-story"" 2004 Boston Red Sox, the Chicago White Sox shocked the baseball world after winning the American League pennant en route to their first World Series since 1959. The forty-six year gap between appearances was the longest inAmerican League history and offered a rare opportunity for some long-overdue redemption for ""Shoeless Joe"" Jackson and his infamous ""Black Sox"" - who were found guilty of throwing the Fall Classic in 1919. The Windy City's south-siders had advanced to the postseason on three other occasions, in 1983 when they lost three of four games to the Baltimore Orioles, in 1993 when the Toronto Blue Jays beat them in six, and in 2000 when the Seattle Mariners dumped them in three. Their last World Championship title had come eighty-eight years earlier when they defeated the New York Giants in 1917.
In the National League...
Bobby Abreu, of the Philadelphia Phillies, broke the record for most round-trippers after putting up twenty-four in the first round of the Century 21 Home Run Derby during the 2005 All-Star Game. The Venezuelan slugger opened the night by slugging a record twenty-four homers in the first round. He then went on to finish second in the second round (8-6) while earning a spot in the finals. Showing no signs of fatigue, he later added eleven more (another record) en route to the title. His longest homer in the final round was four-hundred fifty-eight feet. When totaled, Abreu's forty-one homers combined to travel an estimated distance of seventeen thousand five-hundred sixty-five feet!
After falling short of the postseason in their first forty-two years of existence, the Houston Astros finally weathered the storm, beating the perennial National League East division winners, the Atlanta Braves as well as the National League defending champion St. Louis Cardinals en route to the 2005 World Series. Along the way, Houston and Atlanta set a Major League postseason record with a five hour and fifty minute marathon (sixty seconds longer than a Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees playoff game from the previous season). It ended at 7-6, with a game-winning (and Series ending) home run in the eighteenth-inning, courtesy of Houston's Chris Burke. Aces from both teams combined to throw a whopping five-hundred fifty-three pitches, (Astros: three-hundred, Braves: two-hundred fifty-three) as a forty-three year-old Roger Clemens came unexpectedly ""out of the bullpen"" for his first relief appearance since 1984. Usually a starter, ""The Rocket"" was forced into a closer's role and allowed one hit in three scoreless innings to earn the win.
In a year filled with parity and mediocrity, the San Diego Padres finished the season with an 82-80 record to avoid becoming the first playoff team to ever finish the season at .500 or under. The Padres actually won more games in 2004 (eighty-seven) and recorded back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. Overcoming a seemingly never-ending string of injuries and ailments, the Padres held on to win the National League West, but were later swept 3-0 by the defending National League Champion St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Divisional Series.
Around the League...
Fed up with the lack of initiative by Major League Baseball with regard to the latest steroid scandals, the House Government's Reform Committee took its first step toward intervention, by holding a congressional hearing focusing on the problems of doping in baseball. Following the ongoing investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative known as BALCO, the committee called several past and present players to testify regarding their own knowledge and/or experience with performance-enhancing drugs. (BALCO is a California nutritional supplements company accused of distributing human growth hormones and steroids, as well as Jose Conseco's controversial biography entitled ""Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big."") Former All-Time, single-season homerun champion Mark McGwire, Baltimore Orioles stars Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa and Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling appeared in front of a panel made up of state representatives. Schilling and the Chicago White Sox' Frank Thomas, who gave a statement via videoconference, were invited because of their outspoken views against steroid use. Ultimately hurting the cause more than helping it, Sosa crafted an opening statement in which he said he had never used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. McGwire refused to answer any questions directly, assuming a Fifth Amendment-like stance that ultimately tarnished his legacy in the eyes of many fans. And Palmeiro vehemently denied having used steroids. Unfortunately, ""Raffy"" later went on to become one of the first players to test positive and receive a multiple game suspension. In retrospect, it appeared that the most unpopular member of the panel, Canseco, was apparently the most (if not the only) honest witness.
The newly relocated Washington Nationals (formerly the Montreal Expos) ended their first season since returning to the nation's capital with an 81-81 record. Even before the 2005 Spring Training season had ended, manager Frank Robinson promised that the Nationals would be a competitive franchise, despite having one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. With a surprise ten-game winning streak, starting in late May, the Nationals proved they were a competent team, capable of playing 500+ ball. By July 3rd, Washington became the third team in baseball to reach the fifty-win plateau and was on a pace to win one-hundred games. The Nationals remained in Wild Card contention until the New York Mets eliminated them from the race on September 25th.
""I think he (Albert Pujols) deserved it (the 2005 Most Valuable Player Award). The voting was the right vote. He was the right choice.He had the most solid season average wise, home-run wise and RBI wise."" - Atlanta Braves Outfielder Andruw Jones on ESPN.com (AP Wire, 11/16/2005)

Only three players in the major leagues hit for the cycle during the 2005 season and all three played in the National League. Those three circuit hitters were: Mark Grudzielanek (St. Louis | April 27, 2005), Brad Wilkerson (Washington | April 6, 2005) and Randy Winn (San Francisco | August 15, 2005).
The National League assault on the career records continued in 2005 as Craig Biggio raised his most times hit by a pitch in a career to two-hundred seventy three (273), Barry Bonds raised his most bases on balls in a career to two-thousand three hundred eleven (2,311) & his most intentional bases on balls in a career to six-hundred six (606), Chipper Jones raised his most career home runs by a switch hitter to three-hundred thirty-one (331), Jeff Kent raised his most career home runs by a second baseman to three-hundred six (306) and Mike Piazza raised his most career home runs by a catcher to three-hundred seventy-six (376).
Did you know that the Chicago Cubs have now tied a National League record for most consecutive seasons (97) without winning the World Series? Do you know whose record they have tied? It belongs to the Philadelphia Phillies who began as a franchise in 1883 and had to wait until the 1980 World Series before winning their first Fall Classic.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2016 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the European Union, a politico-economic union of twenty-eight member states that are located primarily in Europe.
The 2016 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad and commonly known as Rio 2016, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 5th through August 21st, 2016.
News in the United States was virtually dominated by clashes between the two presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
In the American League...
New York Yankees rookie sensation Gary Sanchez became; the fastest player in Major League history to reach 11 home runs, doing so in his 23rd career game on August 27, 2016, against the Baltimore Orioles, the first rookie in Major League history to win consecutive Player of the Week awards, and when he hit his 19th home run on September 21, 2016, against the Tampa Bay Rays, he became the quickest player in Major League history to hit 19 home runs, doing so in his 45th game.
On August 19, 2016, the Baltimore Orioles set a new Major League record by hitting four home runs before recording their first out, in the course of a five run first inning against the Houston Astros.
The Cleveland Indians defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2016 ALCS despite hitting just .168, setting a Major League record for the lowest batting average for a winning team in a postseason series. When they defeated the Chicago Cubs 1–0 in Game 3 of the 2016 World Series, it was their fifth shutout of the postseason, also a Major League record!
In the National League...
The 2016 San Diego Padres became the first team in Major League history to be shut out in three consecutive games to open a season. San Diego lost to Los Angeles by the scores of 15–0 (the largest shutout victory on Opening Day in Major League history.), 3–0 and 7–0, respectively.
Jake Arrieta (Chicago Cubs) threw his second career no-hitter, destroying the Cincinnati Reds 16–0 on April 21, 2016. Arrieta walked four and struck out six as he became the fourth reigning Cy Young winner (joining Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, and Clayton Kershaw), to throw a no-hitter the following season.
The Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins played a special neutral-site game at Fort Bragg Stadium, on July 3, 2016, a newly constructed field in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in observance of the Independence Day long weekend. It was the first professional, regular-season sporting event held on an active military installation.
Around the League...
The Major League Baseball All-Star Game's 87th edition was played on July 12, 2016, at Petco Park in San Diego, California, home of the San Diego Padres. The American League, who won the All-Star Game 4–2, also won home-field advantage in the 2016 World Series.
New to the rule book in 2016, Rule 6.01(j), which created criteria for a legal slide while trying to break up a double play, which is defined as making contact with the ground before reaching the base, being able to and attempting to reach the base with a hand or foot, being able to and attempting to remain on the base at the completion of the slide (except at home plate) and not changing his path for the purpose of initiating contact with a fielder.
""It might as well be a matchup from a movie: the two teams with the longest title droughts in baseball paired in the same World Series. No wonder, then, that Joe Maddon has watched Field of Dreams since his Chicago Cubs clinched the National League pennant. 'I cry easily,' said Maddon, the Cubs’ manager. 'So the connection to the past is very important.' To loosely quote the script, the memories could be so thick at this World Series, the fans will have to swat them away from their faces. The Cubs have gone 108 years without a championship. The Cleveland Indians have gone 68. No other team in baseball has come close to so many consecutive unfulfilled seasons. 'The baseball gods are really happy right now,' the Indians' Mike Napoli said. 'I wanted the Cubs to win, just because I knew how cool it would be to be a part of it. I think it's going to be a special World Series. There's two droughts, and there’s going to be a winner.'"" - New York Times Staff Writer Tyler Kepner (10/24/2016, World Series Preview: For Cubs or Indians, Decades of Waiting Are Nearly Over, Source)

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2017 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
News in the United States - and around many parts of the World - included the ongoing support, and non-support, for the President of the United States, Donald Trump. Though Baseball Almanac did not officially measure this statistic, we believe that either Trump, or his tweets, made the headlines, every single day of the year.
North Korea spent most of the year making international headlines with their nuclear missile tests. On February 3rd they fired a ballistic missile across the Sea of Japan, prompting world talks that continued throughout the year. By September 3rd, they had conducted their sixth, and most powerful, nuclear test.
In the American League...
On April 17, 2017, Patriots' Day, the Boston Red Sox wore home white jerseys with ""BOSTON"" written on the front to mark the four year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings. The uniform also sported the 2013 navy-blue circular patch with a white border on the left shoulder saying ""B Strong"" (with the red B in the classic font featured on the Red Sox's caps).
Five American League teams retired numbers for players during the 2017 regular season, they are (in chronological order): Derek Jeter had his #2 retired by the New York Yankees on May 14th. David Ortiz had his #34 retired by the Boston Red Sox on June 23rd. Mark Buehrle had his #56 retired by the Chicago White Sox on June 24th. Edgar Martinez had his #11 retired by the Seattle Mariners on August 12th. And, Ivan Rodriguez had his #7 retired by the Texas Rangers on August 12th.
Joe DiMaggio's 1936 record for most home runs in a season by a rookie Bronx Bomber, fell in 2017, to Rookie of the Year recipient Aaron Judge. Joltin Joe's mark of 29 fell before the All-Star break making Judge only the second rookie in baseball history to reach 30 before the Midsummer Classic. After the contest, Aaron continued his assault on the record books and finished the season with 50 dingers, a new Major League record.
In the National League...
The 2017 Atlanta Braves played their first season at SunTrust Park in Cumberland, Georgia. It succeeds Turner Field as the Braves home ballpark. The first game at SunTrust Park was on April 14, 2017, against the San Diego Padres.
Edinson Volquez threw his first career no-hitter, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks 3–0 on June 3. Volquez walked two and struck out ten while facing the minimum on 98 pitches - 65 of them were strikes! It was the sixth no-hitter by a Miami Marlins pitcher, and the only no hitter of the year from either league.
On August 20, the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals played a game at the minor league BB&T Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The game coincided with the Little League World Series, held annually in nearby South Williamsport, and was exclusively attended by Little League players and their families.
Around the League...
In March 2017, the following Major League Baseball rule changes went into affect, after being ratified by the Major League Baseball Players Association:
The start of a no-pitch intentional walk, allowing the defensive team's manager to signal a decision to the home plate umpire to intentionally walk the batter. Following the signal of the manager's intention, the umpire will immediately award first base to the batter.
A 30-second limit for a manager to decide whether to challenge a play and invoke replay review.
When a manager has exhausted his challenges for the game, Crew Chiefs may now invoke replay review for non-home run calls beginning in the eighth inning instead of the seventh inning.
A conditional two-minute guideline for Replay Officials to render a decision on replay review, allowing various exceptions.
A prohibition on the use of any markers on the field that could create a tangible reference system for fielders.
An addition to Rule 5.07 formalizes an umpire interpretation by stipulating that a pitcher may not take a second step toward home plate with either foot or otherwise reset his pivot foot in his delivery of the pitch. If there is at least one runner on base, then such an action will be called as a balk under Rule 6.02(a). If the bases are unoccupied, then it will be considered an illegal pitch under Rule 6.02(b).
An amendment to Rule 5.03 requires base coaches to position themselves behind the line of the coach's box closest to home plate and the front line that runs parallel to the foul line prior to each pitch. Once a ball is put in play, a base coach is allowed to leave the coach's box to signal a player so long as the coach does not interfere with the play.
The 88th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played on July 11, 2017, at Marlins Park, the home of the Miami Marlins. For the first time since 2002, when the game ended in a tie, the All Star Game would not determine home field advantage for the World Series. Instead, home field advantage will be awarded to the team with the better regular season record.
As a consequence of Hurricane Harvey damaging the Houston area, the interleague match-up between the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros from August 29–31, was moved from Minute Maid Park to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. Although the Astros were the designated home team, they wore their away uniforms during the three-game Lone Star Series, while the Rangers wore their home uniforms.
""Twenty years ago, when you talked to National League owners about the DH, you'd think you were talking some sort of heretical comment,"" Manfred told reporters Thursday at the owners meetings in Coral Gables, Fla. ""But we have a newer group. There's been turnover. And I think our owners in general have demonstrated a willingness to change the game in ways that we think would be good for the fans, always respecting the history and traditions of the sport."" - New York Daily News Staff Peter Botte (01/21/2016, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred says National League could implement DH by 2017, Source)

The New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs set a new Major League record for most strikeouts in a game with 48 on May 7, 2017, in a game that lasted 18 innings. The previous record of 43 was set on July 9, 1971, in a game between the California Angels and the Oakland Athletics.
Scooter Gennett, on June 6, 2017, hit a grand slam in the third inning, a two-run homer in the fourth, a solo shot in the sixth, and another two-run homer in the eighth - the 17th player in Major League history, and the first from the Cincinnati Reds, to hit four home runs in a game.
San Francisco Giants ace, Madison Bumgarner, displayed his home run power by going deep twice on Opening Day, the first pitcher in Major League history to hit two home runs on Opening Day!

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2018 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The year started with some history making news in the National Football League as the Philadelphia Eagles won their first Super Bowl in franchise history, defeating the heavily favored (yet again) New England Patriots, 41-33, in Super Bowl LII, ending a 57-year championship drought.
In the American League...
The Detroit Tigers modified the Olde English D on their home jersey to match the D on the cap. This was the first major change to the Tigers' home jersey since 1934.
A ""feel good"" story of the year surrounded the return of Atlanta Braves pitcher Jonny Venters. The Tampa Bay Rays stuck with the determined lefty who had Tommy John surgery three times and successfully returned to the mound on April 25, 2018 - the first pitcher to make it back to the majors after three such operations.
In the National League...
The 89th Major League Baseball All-Star Game will be held on July 17, 2018, at Nationals Park, the home of the Washington Nationals.
The National League & American League had a combined 7,335 strikeouts and 6,992 hits during the month of April. Never in Major League history had their been a month with more strikeouts than hits, until 2018!
Around the League...
All thirty Major League Baseball teams were scheduled to play an Opening Day game on March 29, 2018, the earliest start of a regular season in baseball history.
Major League Baseball implemented new pace of play rules in 2018, which include limiting the amount of mound visits for each team to six visits per nine innings. Teams will receive an additional visit for every extra inning played.
Under the new collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, the 2018 regular season was extended to 187 days in order to add four additional off-days for all teams.
""Twenty years ago, when you talked to National League owners about the DH, you'd think you were talking some sort of heretical comment,"" Manfred told reporters Thursday at the owners meetings in Coral Gables, Fla. ""But we have a newer group. There's been turnover. And I think our owners in general have demonstrated a willingness to change the game in ways that we think would be good for the fans, always respecting the history and traditions of the sport."" - Botte, Peter. New York Daily News Staff Writer. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred says National League could implement DH by 2017. 21 January 2016.

Joe Panik etched his name in baseball history during the 2018 season with the Giants, achieving a remarkable feat never seen before in Major League play: he launched home runs in back-to-back season-opening 1-0 victories for his team on March 29 and March 30. A clutch performance for the record books!
On April 10, 2018, Asdrubal Cabrera homered batting righty, then again lefty, in the same game - the twenty-second time the New York Mets have had a player accomplish the feat, most in National League history, second only behind the New York Yankees.
Did you know that Barry Bonds had his #25 retired by the San Francisco Giants on August 11, 2018 — the ninth player in franchise history (including time in New York) to have his number retired by the team?

YEAR IN REVIEW: 2019 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The 2019 Major League Baseball season began on March 20, 2019, and is the 150th anniversary of professional baseball, dating back to the 1869 foundation of the Cincinnati Reds.
Four rule changes went into effect in 2019. The time between innings was reduced from 2:05 to 2:00 in local games, and 2:25 to 2:00 in nationally televised games. The August trade deadline was cancelled, leaving just one trade deadline in Major League Baseball, July 31, 2019. The last two were related to the Midsummer Classic, the first is a two-round voting method for fans to select All-Stars, the second will award the winner of the Home Run Derby a $1,000,000 bonus!
In the American League...
The Cleveland Indians agreed to stop using their ""Chief Wahoo"" logo on January 29, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the team unveiled new uniforms excluding the Chief Wahoo logo, as well as new hats with red brims for home games, a new red-colored home alternate jersey (marking the team's first red jersey since the 1970s), and sleeve patches commemorating their hosting of the 2019 All-Star Game.
The regular season began on March 20, 2019, when the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners played a two-game series in Tokyo, Japan, at the Tokyo Dome.
A London Series was played on June 29-30, 2019, when the Boston Red Sox faced-off against the New York Yankees at London Stadium in London, England, on June 29 and 30 making it the first ever regular season series in London under a two-year commitment.
In the National League...
Derek Jeter, CEO of the Miami Marlins, unveiled a new logo, team colors, and uniform on November 16, 2018, for the 2019 season. The new design replaced the one used after the team moved to Marlins Park in 2012, and switched from the Florida Marlins to the Miami Marlins.
The Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs played a game on August 18, 2019, coinciding with the Little League World Series. The MLB Little League Classic was played at BB&T Ballpark, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, for the third straight year.
Around the League...
Opening Day for all teams took place on March 28, 2019, the earliest Opening Day in baseball history when you exclude international season openers. The previous earliest Opening Day was on March 29, 2018.
The second annual Mexico Series of regular season games featured four matchups in 2019. The first match-up was the National League St. Louis Cardinals versus the Cincinnati Reds. The two-game series was played at Monterrey, Mexico's Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey, on April 13 and 14, 2019. The second two-game series, also in Monterrey, featured the American League Houston Astros versus the Los Angeles Angels on May 4 and 5, 2019.
The 90th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held on July 9, 2019, at Progressive Field, home of the Cleveland Indians.
""Twenty years ago, when you talked to National League owners about the DH, you'd think you were talking some sort of heretical comment,"" Manfred told reporters Thursday at the owners meetings in Coral Gables, Fla.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 2020 NATIONAL LEAGUE
Off the field...
The 2020 Major League Baseball regular season began on July 23, 2020, and came to a conclusion on September 27, 2020. Shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic each team played sixty regular season games.
On March 26, 2020, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached an agreement on multiple considerations related to the start of the season being delayed, including pro-rated player salaries, based on the 60-game format, however, players did receive full service time for the shortened season.
For 2020, Team Marketing Report calculated five billion dollars in game day losses for Major League Baseball as a result of not having fans in any ballparks for any regular season games.
In the American League...
On July 18, 2020, the Canadian government denied permission for the Toronto Blue Jays to play their home games at Rogers Centre stating that repeated cross-border trips by both the Blue Jays and their opponents would be a major risk due to the higher spikes in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. compared to those in Canada. The Blue Jays then chose to play their home games at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, home of their Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons
On August 16, 2020, the Chicago White Sox hit four consecutive home runs, tying the Major League record. The history making quartet was Yoan Moncada, Yasmani Grandal, José Abreu and Eloy Jiménez. All four home runs were hit off Roel Ramírez, during his big league debut.
When the Houston Astros made it to the postseason in 2020, Dusty Baker became the first manager in Major League history to lead five different teams to the playoffs!
In the National League...
The designated hitter was used in both the American and National Leagues, not just during interleague games, but in every single game played by every National League team in 2020.
The 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers set the National League record for most home runs in a month by a team after hitting their 57th long ball during August against the Texas Rangers on August 30.
The first team in Major League history to hit at least one grand slam in four consecutive games was the San Diego Padres, who made baseball history on August 17, 18, 19, and 20! All of the record setting grand slams were hit against the Texas Rangers!
Around the League...
On July 23, 2020, MLB and MLBPA announced that the postseason will be an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for 2020 only, instead of the normal 10-team tournament. All first and second place teams in the six divisions will qualify for the playoffs. The final two spots in each league will go to the remaining teams with the best win-loss records. The teams in each league will be seeded by division winners (1–3), division runners-up (4–6), and best teams remaining (7–8). Seeding ties will be resolved by head-to-head record, intra-league record, and record in final 20 intra-league games, to remove the necessity for additional games. The first round of the playoffs will be a best-of-three series called the Wild Card Series, with all games to be played at the home of the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason will follow the usual pattern of five-game Division series, seven-game League Championship Series, and a seven-game World Series.
On July 30, 2020, effective on August 1, all doubleheaders were scheduled as two seven-inning games. One standard doubleheader, which was played on July 28 before the rule change, had already occurred, but due to the number of cancelled games, and doubleheaders needed for each team to reach sixty games played, the length of the doubleheaders was adjusted during the season.
The 91st Major League Baseball All-Star Game was scheduled for July 14, 2020, in Dodger Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Dodgers. On July 3, 2020, the All-Star Game was cancelled, and awarded back to the Dodgers in 2022.
""I mean, it's a little different because we just played 60 games and I didn't get to play all 60 games. I just feel good about it (winning the National League batting title) because you see how consistent you've got to be to win it. That means you've got to be consistent the whole two months. So, it just feels good."" - Juan Soto

2020 National League Standings
  Luis Garcia made his big league debut on August 14, 2020. Three days later, on August 17, Garcia hit his first homer and became the first Major League player born in the 2000s with a home run!
Did you know that when Ian Happ, Jason Heyward, and Kyle Schwarber each homered twice in the same game, on August 30, 2020, it was the first time in baseball history that a starting outfield trio had multi-homers in the same game?
On September 13, 2020, Alec Mills struck out five hitters and walked three, throwing 74 of his 114 pitches for strikes, and completing the only National League no-hitter of the season.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1883 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the Field...
U.S. Congress created the Civil Service Commission to oversee the hiring for all Government civilian jobs. The service assisted in filling positions in a wide variety of professional, technical, clerical, craft and other occupations. Several years later, it underwent a complete reform by President Theodore Roosevelt who held the ideal that the Government should be the great arbiter of the conflicting economic forces in the Nation, especially between capital and labor, guaranteeing justice to each and dispensing favors to none.
In the National League...
The National League regulated stockings for the first time as Boston wore red, Buffalo; gray, Chicago; white, Cleveland; blue, Providence; light blue, Detroit; brown, Philadelphia; blue and white checks and New York; crimson and black.
Charles ""Old Hoss"" Radbourn tossed an 8-0 no-hitter against the Cleveland Blues on July 25th. Radbourn was one of the most dominant pitchers of his day winning thirty-one in 1882, forty-nine in 1883 and an incredible sixty games in 1884 (including twenty-six out of the final twenty-seven).
Hugh Daily, a one armed pitcher for Cleveland, threw a 1-0 no-hitter against Philadelphia on September 13th. Known as ""One Arm"", Daily pitched six seasons in the Major Leagues compiling a 73-87 record.
In the American Association...
During the pre-season, the American Association and National League agreed to terms of peace including a promise not to raid players from each other's league.
The American Association champion Philadelphia Athletics lost their first eight post-season exhibition games resulting in the cancellation of a ""World Series"" against the National League pennant-winning Boston Beaneaters.
""(John) Reilly was one of the major league American Association's stars, and he played his entire career in his hometown of Cincinnati. A smooth-fielding, 6'3"" first baseman, Long John tied for the AA lead with eleven home runs in 1884 and led with thirteen HR and one-hundred three RBI in 1888."" - Professor / Historian Duane A. Smith

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1884 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the field...
Amusement Park promoter La Marcus Thompson built America's first modern roller coaster at Coney Island; Brooklyn, New York called ""The Gravity Pleasure Switchback Railway"". The groundbreaking ride incorporated a flat steel track nailed onto several layers of wooden planks. Two forty-five foot towers were then connected with ramp that allowed the ride to reach a top speed of six miles per hour. The train cars had to be manually towed to the top of the hills at the beginning of both tracks and the patrons were required to get out at the end of the first track and climb stairs to the second hill to board the train again for a return trip. Despite the inconveniences, at only five cents per ride, the ticket profits repaid Thompson's original investment in less than three weeks.
In the National League...
The National League expanded its schedule to one-hundred twelve games.
A rivalry was born in the ""Big Apple"" as the New York Giants and Brooklyn Trolley-Dodgers met for the first time in an exhibition game on April 18th.
On June 27th, Larry Corcoran of the Chicago White Stockings became the first pitcher in Major League history with three career no-hitters after blanking the Providence Grays 6-0.
In the American Association...
Decades before Jackie Robinson ""officially"" broke baseball's color barrier, Moses Fleetwood Walker played forty-six Major League games for the American Association's Toledo Blue Stockings.
Thirty-one year-old rookie Sam Kimber (Brooklyn Trolley-Dodgers) tossed an eleven-inning, no-hitter against the Toledo Blue Stockings on October 4th. Unfortunately, darkness came before someone could score and the game was called at a 0-0 tie.
In the Union Association...
Outfielder Harry Wheeler became the only player ever to appear with five separate teams during the same season. Wheelers 1884 resume included five games with the St. Louis Browns (in the American Association) then on to the Union Association's Kansas City Unions (twenty games), Chicago Browns (seventeen games), Pittsburgh Stoogies (seventeen games) and Baltimore Monumentals (seventeen games).
Philadelphia Keystones catcher Jack Clements became the first player ever to wear a chest protector in a Major League game. Roger Bresnahan would later popularize the device.
""David Orr, the old-time baseball player who covered first base for the Columbus American Association team in 1880, and later for the Brooklyn Nationals, died suddenly of heart disease Wednesday night at the home of his niece, Mrs. Harry Britton, in Richmond Hill."" - New York Times Obituary. 4 June 1919.

On May 1, 1884, Fleet Walker of the 1884 Toledo Blue Stockings stepped on the field and became the first black Major League baseball player. He had a tough day going 0-for-3 at the plate and committing four errors in the field, but improved during his next forty-one games until injuries sidelined him in September.
Did you know that the most passed balls by a catcher during an American Association game is six? That infamous record belongs to Alex Gardner of the 1884 Washington Nationals who was behind the plate on May 10, 1884, playing in his first (and only) Major League game.
The Columbus Colts were the first American Association team to fold, despite finishing second in 1884 and sixth in 1883. Their entire roster was sold to the Pittsburgh Alleghenys franchise for the total price of $6,000 on October 30, 1884.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1885 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the field...
The Statue of Liberty arrived in New York aboard the French ship ISERE. Later assembled on Ellis Island in New York Harbor, the one-hundred fifty-one foot statue was a gift of international goodwill from the people of France to the people of the United States. She was completed and dedicated on October 28th, 1886 and was designated a National Monument on October 15th, 1924. The Statue was extensively restored in time for her spectacular centennial on July 4th, 1986 and today she is still considered THE universal symbol of political freedom and democracy.
In the National League...
The National League began its season with the founding franchise members including the Boston Beaneaters, Chicago White Stockings, Buffalo Bisons, Detroit Wolverines, New York Giants, Philadelphia Phillies and Providence Grays. After the Union Association folded, the Cleveland Spiders and St. Louis Unions merged into a new National League franchise named the St. Louis Maroons. At the conclusion of the season, the Bison and Grays dropped out and were replaced by the Washington Senators and Kansas City Cowboys.
Spring Training began as Cap Anson and his Chicago White Stockings traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas to prepare for the upcoming season.
Art Irwin of the Providence Grays developed the first known fielder's glove after padding a buckskin glove to protect his two broken fingers.
In the American Association...
The American Association leading St. Louis Browns and National League champion Chicago White Stockings went head-to-head for six Championship games (winning three each) resulting in a rare tie. Despite the forming of a special committee to determine a winner, both teams were declared champions and split the $1,000 purse - $500 each.
Both the American Association and National League set a maximum pay cap at $2,000 with no bonuses.
""Wounds of a knife that was plunged into Big Ed Morris's chest during a fight at a fish fry given in his honor Monday night caused the death of the veteran pitcher for the Boston Red Sox here today."" - New York Times (March 4, 1932)

On June 7, 1885, the American Association formally adjusted their rules stating that all pitchers using an overhand delivery can do so without any type of delivery restrictions.
Did you know that the most consecutive games won on a team's home field by any Major League franchise is twenty-seven? That record belongs to the American Association St. Louis Browns who were finally defeated on July 18, 1885 by the Philadelphia Athletics.
The entire American Association cancelled all their games on August 8, 1885 in respect to the burial of former President Ulysses S. Grant in New York City, New York.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1886 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the field...
A bombing at Haymarket Square in Chicago killed seven policemen and injured many others. The attack occurred during a demonstration for an eight-hour workday that was organized by eight alleged anarchists who were later arrested and accused of the crime. Following a speedy trial, three were imprisoned; one committed suicide and four others were hanged. In 1893, Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld pardoned the three survivors after accusations of an unfair trial surfaced.
In the National League...
Pitcher Jim McCormick of the Chicago White Stockings topped the New York Giants 7-3 on July 1st for his sixteenth consecutive win.
""The Bible of Baseball"" aka The Sporting News was established in St. Louis Missouri.
In the American Association...
The American Association Champion St. Louis Browns took on the National League Champion Chicago White Stockings and beat them in six games for the Championship title.
Tip O'Neil of the Browns became the first player ever to hit two round-trippers in championship play after knocking two inside-the-park homers en route to a 12-0 massacre over Chicago.
Baltimore Orioles pitcher Matt Kilroy posted five-hundred thirteen strikeouts in sixty-eight games, but still finished the season with a 29-34 record and a last-place team.
""Although Mr. Larkin played baseball when the rules of the game were vastly different from those of today, he professed recently not to see much difference."" - New York Times Obituary (February 2, 1942)

On August 24, 1886, Matt Kilroy of the Baltimore Orioles struck out sixteen Philadelphia Athletics batters - a single game high for the season where he set the all-time record for strikeouts with five-hundred thirteen.
Did you know that fans who attended games in the New York Metropolitans park on Staten Island were able to watch the Statue of Liberty being built while they enjoyed a game of baseball?
The 1886 American Association batting champion was Guy Hecker (.341) who narrowly defeated Pete Browning (.340). However, Hecker was a pitcher and became the first and only hurler to ever win a batting title from any league in any season in Major League history.

English author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes story ""A Study in Scarlet"" was published. Doyle's brilliant and theatrical hero solved all of his extraordinarily complex cases through what he called ""ingenious deductive reasoning"". His companion, Dr. Watson, narrated the stories and both characters helped to redefine the mystery novel. Doyle later abandoned his medical practice in 1890 and devoted his time to writing. Other works of the great detective included The Sign of the Four (1890), The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902), The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905), His Last Bow (1917), and The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, (1927).
In the National League...
The Philadelphia Phillies finished off their 1887 season with an unprecedented sixteen consecutive wins.
Detroit Wolverines owner Frederick Stearnes challenged American Association St. Louis owner Chris Von Der Ahe to a best-of-fifteen Championship series. The Wolverines prevailed winning eight games. Despite appearing in sixteen post-season games, the Browns receive nothing for their efforts as Von Der Ahe refused to share his profits.
In the American Association...
St. Louis Browns first baseman/manager Charles Comiskey became the first baseball player ever paid to endorse a product after lending his name and likeness to Mennell's Penetrating Oil.
Thomas Ramsey of the Louisville Colonels introduced the ""knuckleball"" pitch, which helped him to fan seventeen batters in a single game — twice.
On April 16th, Mike Griffin of the Baltimore Orioles became the first player ever to homer in his first Major League at-bat.

On Opening Day (April 16, 1887) both Mike Griffin and George Tebeau hit home runs; however, they both happened during the first at-bat of their Major League careers making this the first Opening Day for such an event and the first time to players joined this unique club on the same day.
Did you know that there have been only three instances in Major League history where an outfielder has started more than two double plays from his position? They are (in chronological order) June 9, 1887 by Candy Nelson, April 26, 1905 by Jack McCarthy and April 19, 1926 by Ira Flagstead.
On October 1, 1887 league leader in games pitched, complete games, wins and shutouts Matt Kilroy won both ends of a doubleheader and set the Major League record for wins in a single season by a lefthanded pitcher.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1888 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the field...
Serial killer ""Jack the Ripper"" mutilated a number of prostitutes in the East End of London in 1888, setting off a mass hysteria throughout the city. The name ""Jack the Ripper"" originated from a letter apparently written by someone claiming to be the killer at the time of the murders. All five women were brutally slain within a one-mile area radius of each other in the districts of Whitechapel, Spitalfields, Aldgate, and the City of London proper. Despite one of the most intensive manhunts ever conducted by Scotland Yard detectives, ""The Ripper"" was never actually caught, although there were several suspects.
In the National League...
Charles Ferguson, a standout pitcher with the Philadelphia Phillies died on April 29th twelve days after his twenty-fifth birthday. Ferguson had been a thirty-game winner in 1886 and a twenty-game winner in each of his three other Major League seasons.
On July 13th, Harry Staley and Pud Galvin of the Pittsburgh Alleghenys became the first pitchers ever to combine for a double-header shutout after blanking Boston 4-0 and 6-0.
The National League champion New York Giants defeated the American Association's St. Louis Browns (four-time pennant winners) in an eight-game Championship series. Each player earned a $200 bonus plus an additional $128 from to following benefit games. St. Louis owner Chris Von Der Ahe kept the Browns $1,200 pennant purse while referring to his players as ""chumps"" in the papers. As a result, the team had now played in twenty-seven post-season games (over two seasons) without ever receiving a dime.
In the American Association...
American Association umpire John Gaffney changed the system for game calling after moving out from behind the plate — to behind the pitcher when a runner was on base.
Cincinnati Red Stocking fans were able to follow the game using the first ever baseball scorecard.
Perhaps the most famous baseball poem ever written ""Casey at the Bat"" was published in the San Francisco Examiner. Twenty-five year-old author Ernest L. Thayer was paid $5 for his efforts and was simply credited as ""Phin"".

The American Association might have been on the verge of failing, but they were still willing to pioneer new concepts in an effort to make the game better. One of those was a dual umpire system (first used in postseason play in 1887) that began appearing in regular season games during the 1888 season.
Did you know that during the 1888 season, the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers were often referred to in the media as the Brooklyn Bridegrooms — a nickname given them due to the large number of players who married during the offseason?
On August 3, 1888, Sliding Billy Hamilton steals his first Major League base and continues swiping until he reaches the ""impossible to break"" record of nine-hundred twelve. The record is ""in the books"" until Lou Brock surpasses it in 1979.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1889 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the field...
On June 1st, Americans awoke to the news that Johnstown, Pennsylvania had been devastated by the worst flood in U.S. history. Over 2,200 were dead, with many more homeless. Johnstown was a steel company town with a population of 30,000. It had grown quickly into an industrious community known for the quality of its steel. After a night of heavy rains, the South Fork Dam that protected the city collapsed, sending twenty million tons of water crashing down the narrow valley. Filled with huge chunks of debris, the wall of floodwater grew at times to sixty feet high, tearing downhill at forty miles per hour, leveling everything in its path.
In the National League...
John T. Brush approved a new salary classification plan based on rating players personal habits from A to E. Class ""A"" players received $2500 dollars while a Class ""E"" player was paid $1,500 dollars and expected to help clean the clubhouse. The Brotherhood of Professional Baseball Players was displeased with the policy, but managed to avert a strike by proposing the development of a third league.
William Hoy of the Washington Senators became the first outfielder ever to throw out three runners at the plate in a single game. Both deaf and mute from the age of three, Hoy played fourteen years in the majors while hitting .288 with forty home runs and seven-hundred twenty-six runs batted in.
On October 29th, the New York Giants defeated the Brooklyn Trolley-Dodgers in an early nine game version of the ""Subway Series"" world championship.
In the American Association...
The Louisville Colonels set an unwanted Major League record on June 22nd after suffering their twenty-sixth consecutive loss.
The Brooklyn Bridegrooms won the American Association pennant after defeating the Columbus Buckeyes 6-1 on October 14th.
Montgomery Ward organized a third league known as the ""Players League"" consisting of the Boston Reds, Brooklyn Wonders, Buffalo Bisons, Chicago Pirates, Cleveland Infants, New York Giants, Philadelphia Quakers and Pittsburgh Burghers. It was determined that all players moving into the new league for it's 1890 inaugural season would receive three-year contracts with guaranteed 1888 salaries for the first year and no subsequent pay-cuts.
""Gentlemanly and articulate in an age when few ballplayers were, he played as (Harry) Stovey rather than Stowe (his real name) so that his mother would not see his name in box scores."" - Jack Kavanagh

In 1888, it was a nickname. In 1889, it was a team name: The Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers were referred to as the Bridegrooms throughout the previous season due to the large number of betrothed players. The nickname stuck and the Bridegrooms were created.
Did you know that the Kansas City Cowboys were the second (and final [the first was the Columbus Colts on June 14, 1883]) American Association team to score at least one run during every inning of a game? The fabulous feat took place on May 20, 1888 versus the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and the Colts won the high scoring contest 18-12.
The Louisville Colonels experienced what could have been one of the most challenging seasons for any franchise; on June 14, 1889 they lost their twentieth consecutive game and received a $25 fine from their manager just for losing, one day later only six players show up to play and the game is forfeited, eight days later they set the Major League record for consecutive losses (26) and by seasons end they had become the first (and one of only two) American Association team to lose more than one-hundred regular season games.

YEAR IN REVIEW : 1890 AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
Off the field...
Due to a growing concern nationwide over economic power in large corporations, the U.S. Congress passed the first measure to prohibit trusts called the ""Sherman Antitrust Act"". The act, based on the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, declared illegal every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. A fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for one year was set as the maximum penalties for violating the law.
In the National League...
On Labor Day, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys were swept in a rare triple-header by the home team Brooklyn Bridegrooms 10-9, 3-2 and 8-4. The trio of winning pitchers included Bob Caruthers, Tom Lovett and Adonis Terry.
New York Giants slugger Mike Tiernan became the first player ever to hit a home run from one ballpark into another after launching a thirteenth inning blast off the Boston Beaneaters' Kid Nichols that traveled over the centerfield wall at the Polo Grounds into the adjacent Brotherhood Park.
In the American Association...
The Brooklyn Bridegrooms and Cincinnati Reds moved from the American Association to the National League who had also dropped the Washington Senators. The American Association's Kansas City franchise folded, but the Rochester Hop Bitters, Syracuse Stars, Toledo Maumees and Brooklyn Gladiators were added in their place.
Ledell ""Cannonball"" Titcomb tossed a 7-0 no-hitter against the Syracuse Stars on September 15th.
In the Players League...
The newly developed Players League debuted with eight teams (Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, New York Philadelphia and Pittsburgh) as the Buffalo Bisons recorded the greatest opening day winning margin with a 23-2 victory over the Cleveland Infants.
The short-lived Players League folded in December returning all of their players to their original teams. The Pittsburgh franchise deviated from the agreement though and signed second baseman Louis Bierbauer who had originally belonged to the Philadelphia Phillies. After being accused in the papers of being ""Pirates"" the team adopted the nickname and refused to return Bierbauer to their cross-state rivals.

The Brooklyn franchise began as Trolley Dodgers. Several of their players got married, so they became the Bridegrooms. Now that they had dodged trolleys and married wives, they evolved into Gladiators.
Did you know that when the Rochester (8) versus Columbus (3) game played on July 20, 1890 was completed, both teams were arrested? Why? Because it was played on a Sunday!
Jack Stivetts - a pitcher - hit two home runs during the same game on June 10, 1890, August 6, 1891, and June 12, 1896. This pitching / slugging feat has only been duplicated since by Wes Ferrell (5x) and Don Newcombe (3x).

America's most famous concert venue; Carnegie Hall opened in New York with guest conductor Peter Illich Tchaikovsky on the podium. Inside, the elegant and breathtaking 2,800-seat auditorium still remains as one of the worlds finest. For over one-hundred years, the hall has attracted the world's leading orchestras and solo or group performers including Bernstein, Ellington, Fitzgerald, Garland, Sinatra, Dylan, and the Beatles among thousands of others.
In the National League...
At twenty years old, Amos Rusie of the New York Giants became the youngest pitcher ever to toss a no-hitter after blanking the Brooklyn Trolley-Dodgers 6-0 on July 31st.
The Boston Beaneaters won the National League Pennant, while their cross-town rival Reds took the American Association title. For undisclosed reasons, the National League champs declined an invitation for a playoff resulting in no baseball Championship for the first time since 1883.
In the American Association...
Shortstop John J. McGraw debuted for the Baltimore Orioles on August 26th as the ""Blackbirds"" defeated the Columbus Buckeyes 6-5.
Ted Breitenstein of the St. Louis Browns became the first pitcher ever to debut with a no-hitter after shutting out the Louisville Colonels 8-0 on October 4th.
The American Associated folded in December leaving the Baltimore Orioles, St. Louis Browns, Louisville Colonels and Washington Senators to be absorbed into the National League the following season.

On August 17, 1891 the Cincinnati Porkers disbanded after their one-hundred second game enabling the Western League Milwaukee Brewers to be ""brought-up"" to take their place.
Did you know that the first Major League baseball game ever played in Minnesota featured the American Association Milwaukee Brewers defeating the Columbus Colts 5-0 in Athletic Park. on October 2, 1891?
The final American Association season ended with a BANG when the St. Louis Browns allowed Ted Breitenstein to pitch his first ever Major League game on the final day of the season (October 4, 1891). The rookie hurler did not disappoint as he came within one walk of a perfect game and ended with an 8-0 no-hitter versus the defending champion Louisville Colonels.
Where what happened yesterday
is being preserved today.
